# TODO

## for v2

- [x] Properly discuss $E_{ref}$
- [x] Why is $E_{ref} = 0$ working so well for gas phase, and not for solid (and why is $E_\infty$ the good choice here?) â†’ Taucher2020 quicky discuss this :/
- [x] Improve introduction. In particular, tell a bit more about SEI of CIBs and previous attempts (insist on possible degradation pathways). Also, introduce a bit better the goals of the paper.
- [x] Create SI (appendix does not work with achemso).
- [x] Move some stuffs in SI (but check for \ref!!)
- [x] Acknowledgments
- [x] Properly annotate S5-S9 + common scale among graphs?
- [x] Legend Fig. 7a
- [x] Ref. 2?
- [x] Finish outlooks (is anything else worth mentioning?)
- [x] Clean up the bibliography (abbreviation?), check for duplicates
- [x] Difference in density between SJ and SJn?
- [x] RMSD surface atoms
