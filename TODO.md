# TODO

## for v2

- [x] Properly discuss $E_{ref}$
- [ ] Why is $E_{ref} = 0$ working so well for gas phase, and not for solid (and why is $E_\infty$ the good choice here?)
- [ ] Fig. or Figure?
- [ ] Improve introduction. In particular, tell a bit more about SEI of CIBs and previous attempts (insist on possible degradation pathways). Also, introduce a bit better the goals of the paper.
- [x] Create SI (appendix does not work with achemso).
- [x] Move some stuffs in SI (but check for \ref!!)
- [ ] Conclude & abstract (& keywords?)
- [ ] Aknowledgements
- [ ] Clean up the bibliography, check for duplicates
