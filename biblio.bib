	abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has become one of the most widely used surface analysis techniques, and XPS instrumentation has become more user friendly, making the technique available to a large number of researchers. The number of experts in the field, however, has not increased, and XPS data are often misinterpreted in the literature. This paper is intended to provide an introduction to XPS for prospective or novice users. We present the basic principles of the technique including (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) how electrons interact with matter and escape from a surface and how this determines the surface sensitivity of the technique, and (3) how the chemical environment around an element affects the binding energy of its electrons. A description of the instrumentation helps a novice user understand how data are acquired, and information is included on sample preparation and mounting. The important parameters for data acquisition are noted to help guide users starting to acquire data. Interpretation of data on both a qualitative and quantitative level is discussed, and additional sections provide information on more advanced techniques such as angle resolved XPS, small area analysis, near ambient pressure XPS, valence XPS, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.},

In order to explain the observed variations in intensity with respect to the excitation energy, we performed XPS calculations using the WIEN2k code. The new PES module computes the XPS spectra using a combination of partial density of states times excitation-energydependent atomic-orbital cross sections. It considers as additional correction the charge fraction of the corresponding orbital located inside the atomic spheres. The resulting XPS spectra are compared with experimental data for SiO2, PbO2, CeVO4, In2O3 and ZnO at different excitation energies and in general good agreement between the simulated and experimental spectra has been achieved. In some cases significant unexpected contributions like Pb-6d in PbO2 or Zn-4p in ZnO appear and explain some features in the experimental spectra which previously have not been identified.},

GW has become a popular tool to compute valence excitations for a wide range of materials. However, core-level spectroscopy is thus far almost uncharted in GW. We show that single-shot perturbation calculations in the G0W0 approximation, which are routinely used for valence states, cannot be applied for core levels and suffer from an extreme, erroneous transfer of spectral weight to the satellite spectrum. The correct behavior can be restored by partial self-consistent GW schemes or by using hybrid functionals with almost 50\% of exact exchange as a starting point for G0W0. We also include relativistic corrections and present a benchmark study for 65 molecular 1s excitations. Our absolute and relative GW core-level binding energies agree within 0.3 and 0.2 eV with experiment, respectively.},

In complex chemical systems, however, interpretation of the XPS results and peak assignments is not straightforward. This is not least true for Li-batteries, where XPS yet remains a standard technique for interface characterization. In this work, a combined density functional theory (DFT) and experimental XPS study is carried out to obtain the C 1s and O 1s core-level binding energies of organic carbonate molecules on the surface of Li metal. Decomposition of organic carbonates is frequently encountered in electrochemical cells employing this electrode, contributing to the build up of a complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The goal in this current study is to identify the XPS fingerprints of the formed compounds, degradation pathways, and thereby the early formation stages of the SEI. The contribution of partial atomic charges on the core-ionized atoms and the electrostatic potential due to the surrounding atoms on the core-level binding energies, which is decisive for interpretation of the XPS spectra, are addressed based on the DFT calculations. The results display strong correlations between these two terms and the binding energies, whereas electrostatic potential is found to be the dominating factor. The organic carbonate molecules, decomposed at the surface of the Li metal, are considered based on two different decomposition pathways. The trends of calculated binding energies for products from ethereal carbon\textendash ethereal oxygen bond cleavage in the organic carbonates are better supported when compared to the experimental XPS results.},

We further review and discuss subtleties of surface slab creation relevant for performing efficient and accurate calculations of surface properties. We also demonstrate that the nonconvergence of surface energy with respect to slab thickness can be mitigated if the bulk reference energy is calculated from a surface-oriented bulk unit cell, which eliminates Brillouin zone integration errors between the slab and the bulk. Using Pt(111) and Si(111) surfaces as examples, this technique converges the surface energy with respect to slab thickness requiring only one bulk and one relatively thin slab calculation, with moderate k-point densities.

Multivalent ion technologies, which utilize divalent or trivalent ions, like Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+, show promise in achieving greater energy densities than LIBs due to their ability to deposit uniformly on anodes and intercalate into cathodes. While magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) have been the primary area of research for multivalent ion batteries, the cost-effectiveness and abundance of calcium have sparked a growing interest in calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) in recent years. Compared to LIBs, CIBs have the potential to provide longer cycle life, enhanced safety, and increased energy densities. However, the development of CIBs comes with several challenges, such as finding suitable electrode and electrolyte materials that ensure the stability and safety of the battery. The primary hurdle in CIBs lies in the plating/stripping process. There is a significant hindrance preventing the occurrence of plating/stripping in CIBs, which lies in the formation of a passive layer resulting from the decomposition of the electrolyte. The objective of this article is to examine the advancements made in CIBs. Additionally, it aims to comprehensively assess the mechanisms and materials employed in various battery components, as well as the obstacles encountered in CIBs. This includes recent advancements in electrode materials, electrolytes, cell configurations, and the challenges and opportunities for enhancing the performance and commercial viability of CIBs.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in calcium (Ca)-based batteries for sustainable energy storage, there are a limited number of electrolytes that enable the reversible plating/stripping of Ca metal. Consequently, an understanding of the interplay between electrolyte formulation, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition, and electrochemical performance lags behind that of other alkali and alkaline-earth batteries. In this context, this study examines how plating/stripping behavior and SEI formation are modulated by differential changes in solvent composition and the resulting Ca2+--anion speciation in borohydride electrolytes comprising ether solvent blends. Starting with the baseline electrolyte 1 M Ca(BH4)2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF), THF was systematically replaced by 1,2-dimethoxyethane (G1) or bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (G2) over a range of Gx:Ca2+ molar ratios (0--4:1 G1:Ca2+ or 0--3:1 G2:Ca2+). Replacement of THF by glymes increased the plating overpotential and decreased the Coulombic efficiency of Ca plating/stripping, and a marked decrease in electrochemical activity occurred at a composition threshold for each glyme. Comparison between the X-ray photoelectron spectra of electrolyte-soaked Ca and electrodeposited Ca revealed a relative increase in organic C--O species and a decrease in borate species in the electrochemically-formed SEI with increased glyme proportion in the electrolyte. NMR and Raman spectroscopy connected SEI composition to differential Ca2+ coordination, as glymes displace THF from the Ca2+ coordination environment, weaken Ca2+--BH4-- interactions, and prompt BH4-- reorganization. Overall, BH4---facilitated solvent decomposition governs Ca electrochemistry in these systems, as coordinated THF promotes beneficial borate formation but coordinated glymes limit such phases, leading to Ca2+-blocking phases in the SEI. These findings delineate future directions to modulate Ca(BH4)2 coordination toward improving electrolyte reversibility by considering the O-donating ability of the coordinating solvent.},

In this review, based on the passivation mechanism of CMA, the favorable composition of SEI is emphasized with the corresponding electrolytes. It is considered that boron-containing and organic--inorganic hybrid SEI might be preferred. By comparing electrolytes and SEI on CMA with lithium and magnesium metal anodes, the root causes of CMA passivation are further elaborated, enlightening rational design rules of suitable SEI. Furthermore, some noteworthy details when assembling secondary calcium metal batteries (CMBs) are put forward.

Motivated by recent experimental progress, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate early decomposition reactions at the anode-electrolyte interface. By examining different combinations of solvent---tetrahydrofuran (THF) or ethylene carbonate (EC)---and salt---Ca(BH4)2, Ca(BF4)2, Ca(BCl4)2, and Ca(ClO4)2---we identify a variety of behavioral trends between electrolyte solutions. Next, we perform a separate trajectory with pure THF and gradually increased negative charge; despite an addition of -32e, no THF decomposition is detected. Charge analysis reveals that in a reductive environment, THF distributes excess charge evenly across its hydrocarbon backbone, while EC concentrates charge on its ester oxygens and carbonyl carbon, resulting in decomposition. Graphs of charge vs. time for both solvents reveal that EC decomposition products can be reduced by up to five electrons, while those of THF are limited to a single electron. Ultimately, we find Ca(BH4)2 and THF to be the most stable solution investigated herein, corroborating experimental evidence of its suitability as a CIB electrolyte.},

	abstract = {Calcium batteries are rapidly emerging as a potential, future energy storage technology; however, their advancement relies heavily on understanding of the liquid electrolyte component in terms of stability and interactions with a calcium metal anode. Tetrahydrofuran, a cyclic ether, is an experimentally common and promising solvent for the preparation of stable and efficient calcium electrolytes. However, insights into the reasons why are lacking, which could unveil key principles to electrolyte design. In this report, we provide a theoretical study employing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of the interactions of Ca metal with the cyclic ether tetrahydrofuran (THF). The results show that the electrochemical breakdown and decomposition of THF at the Ca surface is highly orientation- and surface-site dependent, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of its instability in a randomly organized bulk solvent. Likewise, in bulk electrolytes, its likelihood for breakdown is further diminished, in preference for coordination Ca2+ to form solvated structure. Hence, the finding that molecules require such strict conditions for their decomposition is an important selection and design principle for any solvent to prepare suitable calcium electrolytes. These findings are critical to the advancement of the calcium batteries.},

Among them, calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are the least explored due to difficult reversible Ca deposition--dissolution. In this work, we examined the stability of four different Ca salts with weakly coordinating anions and three different solvents commonly employed in existing battery technologies to identify suitable candidates for CIBs. By employing Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations on salt-Ca and solvent-Ca interfaces, we find that the tetraglyme solvent and carborane salt are promising candidates for CIBs. Due to the strong reducing nature of the calcium surface, the other salts and solvents readily decompose. We explain the microscopic mechanisms of salt/solvent decomposition on the Ca surface using time-dependent projected density of states, time-dependent charge-transfer plots, and climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations. Collectively, this work presents the first mechanistic assessment of the dynamical stability of candidate salts and solvents on a Ca surface using BOMD simulations, and provides a predictive path toward designing stable electrolytes for CIBs.},

In this paper, we report the study of an electrolyte consisting of Ca(BH4)2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to gain important insight into the role of the liquid solvation environment in facilitating the reversible electrodeposition of this highly reactive, divalent metal. Through interrogation of the Ca2+ solvation environment and comparison with Mg2+ analogs, we show that an ability to reversibly electrodeposit metal at reasonable rates is strongly regulated by dication charge density and polarizability. Our results indicate that the greater polarizability of Ca2+ over Mg2+ confers greater configurational flexibility, enabling ionic cluster formation via neutral multimer intermediates. Increased concentration of the proposed electroactive species, CaBH4+, enables rapid and stable delivery of Ca2+ to the electrode interface. This work helps set the stage for future progress in the development of electrolytes for calcium and other divalent metal batteries.},

C 1s binding energies were calculated with density functional theory (DFT) for 17 structures including eight well-characterized structures on a Co(0001) surface and nine on a Pt(111) surface, while B 1s binding energies were calculated for six well-characterized structures and compared with experimental values. DFT calculations describe the 2.8 eV variation in the C 1s binding energies on Co surfaces, the 4.2 eV variation in the C 1s binding energies on Pt surfaces, and the 5.5 eV variation in the B 1s binding energies in the test sets with average deviations of 85, 73, and 53 meV, respectively. The shift in the C 1s and the B 1s binding energies can be correlated with the calculated charges, though only within homologous series. To illustrate how binding energy calculations can help elucidate catalyst structures, the nature of the resilient carbon species deposited during Fischer--Tropsch synthesis (FTS) over Co/{$\gamma$}-Al2O3 catalysts was studied. The catalysts were investigated using XPS after reaction, and the measured C 1s binding energies were compared with DFT calculations for various stable structures. The XPS peak at 283.0 eV is attributed to a surface carbide, while the peak at 284.6 eV is proposed to correspond to remaining waxes or polyaromatic carbon species. Boron promotion has been reported to enhance the stability of Co FTS catalysts. Again, the combination of XPS with DFT B 1s binding energy calculations helped identify the nature and location of the boron promoter on the Co/{$\gamma$}-Al2O3 catalyst.},

Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to reveal the correlation between the vibrational frequencies of the hydroxyl groups and the distinct hydroxylated surface phases that develop as a function of water exposure. In the low-coverage regime, water monomers, small water clusters, and one-dimensional water chains are formed on the CaO(001) surface. At increasing water coverages, water-induced structural disorder is observed, indicating partial solvation of Ca2+ ions. Partial transformation of CaO(001) into a Ca(OH)2-like phase occurs upon dosing of water at submillibar water pressure. In addition, it was found that interfacial hydroxyl groups formed on the CaO(001) surface during water exposure at temperatures as low as 100 K shift the temperatures for ice desorption and for the transition from amorphous solid water to crystalline ice by 10 K as compared to those for the nonhydroxylated MgO surface.}

The results show that all these methods give reasonably accurate BE's with B3LYP being slightly better than HF but with both PBE0 and LCBPBE being poorer than HF. A rigorous and general decomposition of core level binding energy values into initial and final state contributions to the BE's is proposed that can be used within either HF or DFT methods. The results show that Koopmans' theorem does not hold for the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues. Consequently, Kohn-Sham orbital energies of core orbitals do not provide estimates of the initial state contribution to core level BE's; hence, they cannot be used to decompose initial and final state contributions to BE's. However, when the initial state contribution to DFT BE's is properly defined, the decompositions of initial and final state contributions given by DFT, with several different functionals, are very similar to those obtained with HF. Furthermore, it is shown that the differences of Kohn-Sham orbital energies taken with respect to a common reference do follow the trend of the properly calculated initial state contributions. These conclusions are especially important for condensed phase systems where our results validate the use of band structure calculations to determine initial state contributions to BE shifts.},

CaO films were produced by exposing Ca films to O2 or N2O. Ca surfaces exposed to CO2 become terminated by carbonate complexes (CO23-) while features typical for (Ca--O) bonds are detected underneath the surface.

	abstract = {Surface chemical analysis by XPS is more than 60 years old. During the last 15 years ther-e has been an explosive growth in the publication of XPS peak-fits and interpretations. Unfortunately, these publications suffer from a variety of problems in reliability and usefulness because the new authors are not familiar enough with the science and application of XPS, chemical state assignments, and peak-fitting. Efforts to help new users include journal publications such as self-training guides for peak-fitting, international standards, collections of BEs, examples of peak-fitting, and more. These user guides are useful and are published in journals that are known to publish XPS information. The basics of XPS are taught at a few graduate level courses in universities and there are 3--5 day training courses at conferences, but the need is much greater. To help the international XPS community and the infrequent users of XPS to overcome these limitations, problems and needs, The XPS Library™ was formed as a non-profit institute to provide an on-line resource of XPS information, self-training material, free {$>$}70,000 monochromatic XPS reference spectra, free spectral data processing software, reference tables, links, examples of good and bad peak-fitting, and more. In 1986, this author began to build The XPS Spectra-Base™ by collecting and organizing detailed sets of ``self-consistent'' monochromatic XPS spectra from reference materials, natural crystals, man-made single crystals, and commercial products. The current number of individual spectra in digital form is {$>$}70,000 and the number of materials is {$>$}9,000. Each set of spectra (4--10) is stored inside individual data directories having the name of the material analyzed. Multiple data directories belonging to the same category are placed in a directory with the name of that category. Each category name is distinct and is based on the chemistry of the materials. Currently, ``XPS Library'' members must download individual sets of spectra or full directories that are stored in ZIP files. To view, peak-fit, export, analyze, overlay, process, or print the spectra provided by The XPS Spectra-Base the library member needs a software that can import or directly open spectra having: VAMAS-ISO 14,976 ASCII file format, other ASCII file formats (XY, XYZ), or the SDP binary file format. Most software from the instrument makers can import these types of spectra. The ``Spectral Data Processor'' (SDP™) v8.0 is a 32-bit Windows™ (v7 10 compatible) software is provided free of charge to library members. Using SDP v8 the user can: (a) access and open the raw or processed spectra downloaded from The XPS SpectraBase, (b) save all processing results and labels to permanent memory, (c) completely reprocess, peak-fit, analyze, overlay, process, or print the spectra, (d) export or save the raw or processed spectra in VAMAS-ISO ASCII and other ASCII file formats, and (e) import spectra having VAMAS-ISO 14,976 ASCII file format and other ASCII file formats (XY, XYZ). Several thousand High Energy Resolution Auger Electron Spectra (HER-AES) from insulators, conductors, and native oxides will be added.

The current paper describes how such simulations can be flawed when modeling interfaces between physisorbed organic molecules and metals. The problem occurs when applying periodic boundary conditions to correctly describe extended interfaces and simultaneously considering core hole excitations in the framework of a final-state approach to account for screening effects. Since the core hole is generated in every unit cell, an artificial dipole layer is formed. In this work, we study methane on an Al(100) surface as a deliberately chosen model system for hybrid interfaces to evaluate the impact of this computational artifact. We show that changing the supercell size leads to artificial shifts in the calculated core-level energies that can be well beyond 1 eV for small cells. The same applies to atoms at comparably large distances from the substrate, encountered, for example, in extended, upright-standing adsorbate molecules. We also argue that the calculated work function change due to a core-level excitation can serve as an indication for the occurrence of such an artifact and discuss possible remedies for the problem.},

The composites were composed of {$\alpha$}-Ca(BH4)2, {$\gamma$}-Ca(BH4)2 and orthorhombic LiBH4, and the relative phase quantities of the Ca(BH4)2 polymorphs varied significantly with LiBH4 content. The formation of small amounts of orthorhombic CaH2 and cubic CaH2 in a CaF2-like structure was observed upon heat treatment. Concurrent formation of elemental boron may also occur. The ionic conductivity of the composites was measured using impedance spectroscopy, and was found to be lower than that of ball milled LiBH4. Electronic band structure calculations indicate that cubic CaH2 with hydrogen defects is electronically conducting. Its formation along with the possible precipitation of boron therefore has an effect on the measured conductivity of the LiBH4--Ca(BH4)2 composites and may increase the risk of an internal short-circuit in the cells.},

	abstract = {With more than 9000 papers published annually, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an indispensable technique in modern surface and materials science for the determination of chemical bonding. The accuracy of chemical-state determination relies, however, on a trustworthy calibration of the binding energy (BE) scale, which is a nontrivial task due to the lack of an internal BE reference. One approach, proposed in the early days of XPS, employs the C 1s spectra of an adventitious carbon layer, which is present on all surfaces exposed to air. Despite accumulating criticism, pointing to the unknown origin and composition of the adventitious carbon, this is by far the most commonly used method today for all types of samples, not necessarily electrically insulating. Alarmingly, as revealed by our survey of recent XPS literature, the calibration procedure based on the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon is highly arbitrary, which results in incorrect spectral interpretation, contradictory results, and generates a large spread in reported BE values for elements even present in the same chemical state. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the status quo of XPS with a historical perspective, provide the technique's operating principles, resolve myths associated with C 1s referencing, and offer a comprehensive account of recent findings. Owing to the huge volume of XPS literature produced each year, the consequences of improper referencing are dramatic. Our intention is to promote awareness within a growing XPS community as to the problems reported over the last six decades and present a guide with best practice for using the C 1s BE referencing method.},

	abstract = {The formation of islands of O-atoms is the dominant mode of growth of the oxide in the first stages of oxidation of Al(1\,1\,1). It is however unknown if a similar mechanism exists for other low index surfaces of Al. We performed a density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics investigation of the first stages of the oxidation of Al(1\,1\,0) using two distinct models: a homogeneous surface disposition of O-atoms; and a model where the O-atoms are close-spaced forming clusters or islands. We investigated the surface reactions with oxygen up to a coverage of 2 ML and found that for both models the adsorption energy per dissociating O2(g) becomes more negative with increasing coverage. Our results show that for coverages up to 1.25 ML the oxide forms clusters or islands while for coverages higher than 1.5 ML the oxide covers the surface homogeneously. This is because the O-atoms bind preferably to neighboring sites even at the minimum coverage. With increasing coverage, the clusters of O start to form stripes along the [1\,1{\textasciimacron}\,0] direction. The work function ({$\phi$}) of the surface decreases when going from bare Al(1\,1\,0) to up to 1 ML coverage of O-atoms, but for coverages of 1.25 ML and higher, {$\phi$} increases. The Al 2p surface core level shifts (SCLS) shift towards higher binding energies with increasing surface coverage of O-atoms and start to approach the values of Al 2p in Al2O3 already at a coverage of 2ML. A relation between the SCLS and the coordination number of Al to O-atoms was made. The Al 2p SCLS increases with increasing coordination to O-atoms, for single, twofold and three-fourfold coordinated cations. For the O-atoms that terminate the surface at the short-bridge sites, the SCLS of O 1s, is largely affected by the proximity to other O-atoms. These results demonstrate that the cooperative effects between surface bound O-atoms have important roles in the mechanism of growth of the oxide at Al(1\,1\,0), and similarly to what happens for Al(1\,1\,1), the initial oxidation of Al(1\,1\,0) proceeds via the formation of islands of O-atoms.},

	abstract = {Surfaces of mineral cuprite prepared by fracture under UHV have been characterised by synchrotron XPS and near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy before and after exposure to ambient air. Before exposure of the cuprite, the Cu 2p photoelectron and Cu L2,3-edge absorption spectra were consistent with CuI with very little d9 character. Surface-enhanced O 1s spectra from the unexposed mineral revealed a surface species, with binding energy 0.95{\textpm}0.05eV below the principal cuprous oxide peak, assigned to under-coordinated oxygen. A second surface species, with binding energy about 1eV higher than the principal peak, was assigned to either hydroxyl derived from chemisorbed water vapour or surface oxygen dimers produced by restructuring of the cuprite fracture surface. The width of the principal O 1s peak was 0.66{\textpm}0.02eV. The observed Cu L3- and O K-edge absorption spectra were in good agreement with those simulated for the cuprite structure. After exposure of the fracture surface to ambient air, the low binding energy O 1s surface species was barely discernible, the original high binding energy O 1s surface species remained of comparable intensity, new intensity appeared at an even higher ({$\sim$}1.9eV) binding energy, and the Cu L2,3-edge spectrum indicated the presence of CuII, consistent with the formation of a thin surface layer of Cu(OH)2.},

While the Mg(2p) surface BE shifts to a higher value than bulk by {$\approx$}1 eV as expected from the different surface and bulk Madelung potentials, the O(1s) SCLS is almost 0 rather than {$\approx-$}1 eV, expected from the Madelung potentials. The distortion of the surface atoms from the spherical symmetry of the bulk Mg and O atoms is examined by a novel theoretical procedure. The anomalous O SCLS is shown to arise from the increase of the effective size of surface O anions.},
