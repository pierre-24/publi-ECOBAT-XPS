	abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has become one of the most widely used surface analysis techniques, and XPS instrumentation has become more user friendly, making the technique available to a large number of researchers. The number of experts in the field, however, has not increased, and XPS data are often misinterpreted in the literature. This paper is intended to provide an introduction to XPS for prospective or novice users. We present the basic principles of the technique including (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) how electrons interact with matter and escape from a surface and how this determines the surface sensitivity of the technique, and (3) how the chemical environment around an element affects the binding energy of its electrons. A description of the instrumentation helps a novice user understand how data are acquired, and information is included on sample preparation and mounting. The important parameters for data acquisition are noted to help guide users starting to acquire data. Interpretation of data on both a qualitative and quantitative level is discussed, and additional sections provide information on more advanced techniques such as angle resolved XPS, small area analysis, near ambient pressure XPS, valence XPS, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.},

In order to explain the observed variations in intensity with respect to the excitation energy, we performed XPS calculations using the WIEN2k code. The new PES module computes the XPS spectra using a combination of partial density of states times excitation-energydependent atomic-orbital cross sections. It considers as additional correction the charge fraction of the corresponding orbital located inside the atomic spheres. The resulting XPS spectra are compared with experimental data for SiO2, PbO2, CeVO4, In2O3 and ZnO at different excitation energies and in general good agreement between the simulated and experimental spectra has been achieved. In some cases significant unexpected contributions like Pb-6d in PbO2 or Zn-4p in ZnO appear and explain some features in the experimental spectra which previously have not been identified.},

GW has become a popular tool to compute valence excitations for a wide range of materials. However, core-level spectroscopy is thus far almost uncharted in GW. We show that single-shot perturbation calculations in the G0W0 approximation, which are routinely used for valence states, cannot be applied for core levels and suffer from an extreme, erroneous transfer of spectral weight to the satellite spectrum. The correct behavior can be restored by partial self-consistent GW schemes or by using hybrid functionals with almost 50\% of exact exchange as a starting point for G0W0. We also include relativistic corrections and present a benchmark study for 65 molecular 1s excitations. Our absolute and relative GW core-level binding energies agree within 0.3 and 0.2 eV with experiment, respectively.},

In complex chemical systems, however, interpretation of the XPS results and peak assignments is not straightforward. This is not least true for Li-batteries, where XPS yet remains a standard technique for interface characterization. In this work, a combined density functional theory (DFT) and experimental XPS study is carried out to obtain the C 1s and O 1s core-level binding energies of organic carbonate molecules on the surface of Li metal. Decomposition of organic carbonates is frequently encountered in electrochemical cells employing this electrode, contributing to the build up of a complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The goal in this current study is to identify the XPS fingerprints of the formed compounds, degradation pathways, and thereby the early formation stages of the SEI. The contribution of partial atomic charges on the core-ionized atoms and the electrostatic potential due to the surrounding atoms on the core-level binding energies, which is decisive for interpretation of the XPS spectra, are addressed based on the DFT calculations. The results display strong correlations between these two terms and the binding energies, whereas electrostatic potential is found to be the dominating factor. The organic carbonate molecules, decomposed at the surface of the Li metal, are considered based on two different decomposition pathways. The trends of calculated binding energies for products from ethereal carbon\textendash ethereal oxygen bond cleavage in the organic carbonates are better supported when compared to the experimental XPS results.},

We further review and discuss subtleties of surface slab creation relevant for performing efficient and accurate calculations of surface properties. We also demonstrate that the nonconvergence of surface energy with respect to slab thickness can be mitigated if the bulk reference energy is calculated from a surface-oriented bulk unit cell, which eliminates Brillouin zone integration errors between the slab and the bulk. Using Pt(111) and Si(111) surfaces as examples, this technique converges the surface energy with respect to slab thickness requiring only one bulk and one relatively thin slab calculation, with moderate k-point densities.

Multivalent ion technologies, which utilize divalent or trivalent ions, like Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+, show promise in achieving greater energy densities than LIBs due to their ability to deposit uniformly on anodes and intercalate into cathodes. While magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) have been the primary area of research for multivalent ion batteries, the cost-effectiveness and abundance of calcium have sparked a growing interest in calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) in recent years. Compared to LIBs, CIBs have the potential to provide longer cycle life, enhanced safety, and increased energy densities. However, the development of CIBs comes with several challenges, such as finding suitable electrode and electrolyte materials that ensure the stability and safety of the battery. The primary hurdle in CIBs lies in the plating/stripping process. There is a significant hindrance preventing the occurrence of plating/stripping in CIBs, which lies in the formation of a passive layer resulting from the decomposition of the electrolyte. The objective of this article is to examine the advancements made in CIBs. Additionally, it aims to comprehensively assess the mechanisms and materials employed in various battery components, as well as the obstacles encountered in CIBs. This includes recent advancements in electrode materials, electrolytes, cell configurations, and the challenges and opportunities for enhancing the performance and commercial viability of CIBs.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in calcium (Ca)-based batteries for sustainable energy storage, there are a limited number of electrolytes that enable the reversible plating/stripping of Ca metal. Consequently, an understanding of the interplay between electrolyte formulation, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition, and electrochemical performance lags behind that of other alkali and alkaline-earth batteries. In this context, this study examines how plating/stripping behavior and SEI formation are modulated by differential changes in solvent composition and the resulting Ca2+--anion speciation in borohydride electrolytes comprising ether solvent blends. Starting with the baseline electrolyte 1 M Ca(BH4)2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF), THF was systematically replaced by 1,2-dimethoxyethane (G1) or bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (G2) over a range of Gx:Ca2+ molar ratios (0--4:1 G1:Ca2+ or 0--3:1 G2:Ca2+). Replacement of THF by glymes increased the plating overpotential and decreased the Coulombic efficiency of Ca plating/stripping, and a marked decrease in electrochemical activity occurred at a composition threshold for each glyme. Comparison between the X-ray photoelectron spectra of electrolyte-soaked Ca and electrodeposited Ca revealed a relative increase in organic C--O species and a decrease in borate species in the electrochemically-formed SEI with increased glyme proportion in the electrolyte. NMR and Raman spectroscopy connected SEI composition to differential Ca2+ coordination, as glymes displace THF from the Ca2+ coordination environment, weaken Ca2+--BH4-- interactions, and prompt BH4-- reorganization. Overall, BH4---facilitated solvent decomposition governs Ca electrochemistry in these systems, as coordinated THF promotes beneficial borate formation but coordinated glymes limit such phases, leading to Ca2+-blocking phases in the SEI. These findings delineate future directions to modulate Ca(BH4)2 coordination toward improving electrolyte reversibility by considering the O-donating ability of the coordinating solvent.},

In this review, based on the passivation mechanism of CMA, the favorable composition of SEI is emphasized with the corresponding electrolytes. It is considered that boron-containing and organic--inorganic hybrid SEI might be preferred. By comparing electrolytes and SEI on CMA with lithium and magnesium metal anodes, the root causes of CMA passivation are further elaborated, enlightening rational design rules of suitable SEI. Furthermore, some noteworthy details when assembling secondary calcium metal batteries (CMBs) are put forward.

Motivated by recent experimental progress, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate early decomposition reactions at the anode-electrolyte interface. By examining different combinations of solvent---tetrahydrofuran (THF) or ethylene carbonate (EC)---and salt---Ca(BH4)2, Ca(BF4)2, Ca(BCl4)2, and Ca(ClO4)2---we identify a variety of behavioral trends between electrolyte solutions. Next, we perform a separate trajectory with pure THF and gradually increased negative charge; despite an addition of -32e, no THF decomposition is detected. Charge analysis reveals that in a reductive environment, THF distributes excess charge evenly across its hydrocarbon backbone, while EC concentrates charge on its ester oxygens and carbonyl carbon, resulting in decomposition. Graphs of charge vs. time for both solvents reveal that EC decomposition products can be reduced by up to five electrons, while those of THF are limited to a single electron. Ultimately, we find Ca(BH4)2 and THF to be the most stable solution investigated herein, corroborating experimental evidence of its suitability as a CIB electrolyte.},

	abstract = {Calcium batteries are rapidly emerging as a potential, future energy storage technology; however, their advancement relies heavily on understanding of the liquid electrolyte component in terms of stability and interactions with a calcium metal anode. Tetrahydrofuran, a cyclic ether, is an experimentally common and promising solvent for the preparation of stable and efficient calcium electrolytes. However, insights into the reasons why are lacking, which could unveil key principles to electrolyte design. In this report, we provide a theoretical study employing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of the interactions of Ca metal with the cyclic ether tetrahydrofuran (THF). The results show that the electrochemical breakdown and decomposition of THF at the Ca surface is highly orientation- and surface-site dependent, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of its instability in a randomly organized bulk solvent. Likewise, in bulk electrolytes, its likelihood for breakdown is further diminished, in preference for coordination Ca2+ to form solvated structure. Hence, the finding that molecules require such strict conditions for their decomposition is an important selection and design principle for any solvent to prepare suitable calcium electrolytes. These findings are critical to the advancement of the calcium batteries.},

	abstract = {Multivalent batteries, such as magnesium-ion, calcium-ion, and zinc-ion batteries, have attracted significant attention as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices to complement conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Among them, calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are the least explored due to difficult reversible Ca deposition--dissolution. In this work, we examined the stability of four different Ca salts with weakly coordinating anions and three different solvents commonly employed in existing battery technologies to identify suitable candidates for CIBs. By employing Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations on salt-Ca and solvent-Ca interfaces, we find that the tetraglyme solvent and carborane salt are promising candidates for CIBs. Due to the strong reducing nature of the calcium surface, the other salts and solvents readily decompose. We explain the microscopic mechanisms of salt/solvent decomposition on the Ca surface using time-dependent projected density of states, time-dependent charge-transfer plots, and climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations. Collectively, this work presents the first mechanistic assessment of the dynamical stability of candidate salts and solvents on a Ca surface using BOMD simulations, and provides a predictive path toward designing stable electrolytes for CIBs.},

	abstract = {Development of calcium metal batteries has been historically frustrated by a lack of electrolytes capable of supporting reversible calcium electrodeposition. In this paper, we report the study of an electrolyte consisting of Ca(BH4)2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to gain important insight into the role of the liquid solvation environment in facilitating the reversible electrodeposition of this highly reactive, divalent metal. Through interrogation of the Ca2+ solvation environment and comparison with Mg2+ analogs, we show that an ability to reversibly electrodeposit metal at reasonable rates is strongly regulated by dication charge density and polarizability. Our results indicate that the greater polarizability of Ca2+ over Mg2+ confers greater configurational flexibility, enabling ionic cluster formation via neutral multimer intermediates. Increased concentration of the proposed electroactive species, CaBH4+, enables rapid and stable delivery of Ca2+ to the electrode interface. This work helps set the stage for future progress in the development of electrolytes for calcium and other divalent metal batteries.},

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple `for-loop' construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},
