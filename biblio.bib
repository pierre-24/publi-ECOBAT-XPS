	abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has become one of the most widely used surface analysis techniques, and XPS instrumentation has become more user friendly, making the technique available to a large number of researchers. The number of experts in the field, however, has not increased, and XPS data are often misinterpreted in the literature. This paper is intended to provide an introduction to XPS for prospective or novice users. We present the basic principles of the technique including (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) how electrons interact with matter and escape from a surface and how this determines the surface sensitivity of the technique, and (3) how the chemical environment around an element affects the binding energy of its electrons. A description of the instrumentation helps a novice user understand how data are acquired, and information is included on sample preparation and mounting. The important parameters for data acquisition are noted to help guide users starting to acquire data. Interpretation of data on both a qualitative and quantitative level is discussed, and additional sections provide information on more advanced techniques such as angle resolved XPS, small area analysis, near ambient pressure XPS, valence XPS, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.},

Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation., This article appears in the following collection:},

In order to explain the observed variations in intensity with respect to the excitation energy, we performed XPS calculations using the WIEN2k code. The new PES module computes the XPS spectra using a combination of partial density of states times excitation-energydependent atomic-orbital cross sections. It considers as additional correction the charge fraction of the corresponding orbital located inside the atomic spheres. The resulting XPS spectra are compared with experimental data for SiO2, PbO2, CeVO4, In2O3 and ZnO at different excitation energies and in general good agreement between the simulated and experimental spectra has been achieved. In some cases significant unexpected contributions like Pb-6d in PbO2 or Zn-4p in ZnO appear and explain some features in the experimental spectra which previously have not been identified.},

GW has become a popular tool to compute valence excitations for a wide range of materials. However, core-level spectroscopy is thus far almost uncharted in GW. We show that single-shot perturbation calculations in the G0W0 approximation, which are routinely used for valence states, cannot be applied for core levels and suffer from an extreme, erroneous transfer of spectral weight to the satellite spectrum. The correct behavior can be restored by partial self-consistent GW schemes or by using hybrid functionals with almost 50\% of exact exchange as a starting point for G0W0. We also include relativistic corrections and present a benchmark study for 65 molecular 1s excitations. Our absolute and relative GW core-level binding energies agree within 0.3 and 0.2 eV with experiment, respectively.},

In complex chemical systems, however, interpretation of the XPS results and peak assignments is not straightforward. This is not least true for Li-batteries, where XPS yet remains a standard technique for interface characterization. In this work, a combined density functional theory (DFT) and experimental XPS study is carried out to obtain the C 1s and O 1s core-level binding energies of organic carbonate molecules on the surface of Li metal. Decomposition of organic carbonates is frequently encountered in electrochemical cells employing this electrode, contributing to the build up of a complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The goal in this current study is to identify the XPS fingerprints of the formed compounds, degradation pathways, and thereby the early formation stages of the SEI. The contribution of partial atomic charges on the core-ionized atoms and the electrostatic potential due to the surrounding atoms on the core-level binding energies, which is decisive for interpretation of the XPS spectra, are addressed based on the DFT calculations. The results display strong correlations between these two terms and the binding energies, whereas electrostatic potential is found to be the dominating factor. The organic carbonate molecules, decomposed at the surface of the Li metal, are considered based on two different decomposition pathways. The trends of calculated binding energies for products from ethereal carbon\textendash ethereal oxygen bond cleavage in the organic carbonates are better supported when compared to the experimental XPS results.},

We further review and discuss subtleties of surface slab creation relevant for performing efficient and accurate calculations of surface properties. We also demonstrate that the nonconvergence of surface energy with respect to slab thickness can be mitigated if the bulk reference energy is calculated from a surface-oriented bulk unit cell, which eliminates Brillouin zone integration errors between the slab and the bulk. Using Pt(111) and Si(111) surfaces as examples, this technique converges the surface energy with respect to slab thickness requiring only one bulk and one relatively thin slab calculation, with moderate k-point densities. This process is about an order of magnitude more efficient than popular surface energy convergence techniques involving multiple slab calculations.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in calcium (Ca)-based batteries for sustainable energy storage, there are a limited number of electrolytes that enable the reversible plating/stripping of Ca metal. Consequently, an understanding of the interplay between electrolyte formulation, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition, and electrochemical performance lags behind that of other alkali and alkaline-earth batteries. In this context, this study examines how plating/stripping behavior and SEI formation are modulated by differential changes in solvent composition and the resulting Ca2+--anion speciation in borohydride electrolytes comprising ether solvent blends. Starting with the baseline electrolyte 1 M Ca(BH4)2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF), THF was systematically replaced by 1,2-dimethoxyethane (G1) or bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (G2) over a range of Gx:Ca2+ molar ratios (0--4:1 G1:Ca2+ or 0--3:1 G2:Ca2+). Replacement of THF by glymes increased the plating overpotential and decreased the Coulombic efficiency of Ca plating/stripping, and a marked decrease in electrochemical activity occurred at a composition threshold for each glyme. Comparison between the X-ray photoelectron spectra of electrolyte-soaked Ca and electrodeposited Ca revealed a relative increase in organic C--O species and a decrease in borate species in the electrochemically-formed SEI with increased glyme proportion in the electrolyte. NMR and Raman spectroscopy connected SEI composition to differential Ca2+ coordination, as glymes displace THF from the Ca2+ coordination environment, weaken Ca2+--BH4-- interactions, and prompt BH4-- reorganization. Overall, BH4---facilitated solvent decomposition governs Ca electrochemistry in these systems, as coordinated THF promotes beneficial borate formation but coordinated glymes limit such phases, leading to Ca2+-blocking phases in the SEI. These findings delineate future directions to modulate Ca(BH4)2 coordination toward improving electrolyte reversibility by considering the O-donating ability of the coordinating solvent.},

Nevertheless, as a pivotal part, the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed on CMA has not been paid enough attention to. In this review, based on the passivation mechanism of CMA, the favorable composition of SEI is emphasized with the corresponding electrolytes. It is considered that boron-containing and organic--inorganic hybrid SEI might be preferred. By comparing electrolytes and SEI on CMA with lithium and magnesium metal anodes, the root causes of CMA passivation are further elaborated, enlightening rational design rules of suitable SEI. Furthermore, some noteworthy details when assembling secondary calcium metal batteries (CMBs) are put forward. It is expected that deeper understanding of SEI on CMA will promote the development of CMBs.},

Motivated by recent experimental progress, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate early decomposition reactions at the anode-electrolyte interface. By examining different combinations of solvent---tetrahydrofuran (THF) or ethylene carbonate (EC)---and salt---Ca(BH4)2, Ca(BF4)2, Ca(BCl4)2, and Ca(ClO4)2---we identify a variety of behavioral trends between electrolyte solutions. Next, we perform a separate trajectory with pure THF and gradually increased negative charge; despite an addition of -32e, no THF decomposition is detected. Charge analysis reveals that in a reductive environment, THF distributes excess charge evenly across its hydrocarbon backbone, while EC concentrates charge on its ester oxygens and carbonyl carbon, resulting in decomposition. Graphs of charge vs. time for both solvents reveal that EC decomposition products can be reduced by up to five electrons, while those of THF are limited to a single electron. Ultimately, we find Ca(BH4)2 and THF to be the most stable solution investigated herein, corroborating experimental evidence of its suitability as a CIB electrolyte.},

	abstract = {Multivalent batteries, such as magnesium-ion, calcium-ion, and zinc-ion batteries, have attracted significant attention as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices to complement conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Among them, calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are the least explored due to difficult reversible Ca deposition--dissolution. In this work, we examined the stability of four different Ca salts with weakly coordinating anions and three different solvents commonly employed in existing battery technologies to identify suitable candidates for CIBs. By employing Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations on salt-Ca and solvent-Ca interfaces, we find that the tetraglyme solvent and carborane salt are promising candidates for CIBs. Due to the strong reducing nature of the calcium surface, the other salts and solvents readily decompose. We explain the microscopic mechanisms of salt/solvent decomposition on the Ca surface using time-dependent projected density of states, time-dependent charge-transfer plots, and climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations. Collectively, this work presents the first mechanistic assessment of the dynamical stability of candidate salts and solvents on a Ca surface using BOMD simulations, and provides a predictive path toward designing stable electrolytes for CIBs.},

	abstract = {Development of calcium metal batteries has been historically frustrated by a lack of electrolytes capable of supporting reversible calcium electrodeposition. In this paper, we report the study of an electrolyte consisting of Ca(BH4)2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to gain important insight into the role of the liquid solvation environment in facilitating the reversible electrodeposition of this highly reactive, divalent metal. Through interrogation of the Ca2+ solvation environment and comparison with Mg2+ analogs, we show that an ability to reversibly electrodeposit metal at reasonable rates is strongly regulated by dication charge density and polarizability. Our results indicate that the greater polarizability of Ca2+ over Mg2+ confers greater configurational flexibility, enabling ionic cluster formation via neutral multimer intermediates. Increased concentration of the proposed electroactive species, CaBH4+, enables rapid and stable delivery of Ca2+ to the electrode interface. This work helps set the stage for future progress in the development of electrolytes for calcium and other divalent metal batteries.},

C 1s binding energies were calculated with density functional theory (DFT) for 17 structures including eight well-characterized structures on a Co(0001) surface and nine on a Pt(111) surface, while B 1s binding energies were calculated for six well-characterized structures and compared with experimental values. DFT calculations describe the 2.8 eV variation in the C 1s binding energies on Co surfaces, the 4.2 eV variation in the C 1s binding energies on Pt surfaces, and the 5.5 eV variation in the B 1s binding energies in the test sets with average deviations of 85, 73, and 53 meV, respectively. The shift in the C 1s and the B 1s binding energies can be correlated with the calculated charges, though only within homologous series. To illustrate how binding energy calculations can help elucidate catalyst structures, the nature of the resilient carbon species deposited during Fischer--Tropsch synthesis (FTS) over Co/{$\gamma$}-Al2O3 catalysts was studied. The catalysts were investigated using XPS after reaction, and the measured C 1s binding energies were compared with DFT calculations for various stable structures. The XPS peak at 283.0 eV is attributed to a surface carbide, while the peak at 284.6 eV is proposed to correspond to remaining waxes or polyaromatic carbon species. Boron promotion has been reported to enhance the stability of Co FTS catalysts. Again, the combination of XPS with DFT B 1s binding energy calculations helped identify the nature and location of the boron promoter on the Co/{$\gamma$}-Al2O3 catalyst.},

Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to reveal the correlation between the vibrational frequencies of the hydroxyl groups and the distinct hydroxylated surface phases that develop as a function of water exposure. In the low-coverage regime, water monomers, small water clusters, and one-dimensional water chains are formed on the CaO(001) surface. At increasing water coverages, water-induced structural disorder is observed, indicating partial solvation of Ca2+ ions. Partial transformation of CaO(001) into a Ca(OH)2-like phase occurs upon dosing of water at submillibar water pressure. In addition, it was found that interfacial hydroxyl groups formed on the CaO(001) surface during water exposure at temperatures as low as 100 K shift the temperatures for ice desorption and for the transition from amorphous solid water to crystalline ice by 10 K as compared to those for the nonhydroxylated MgO surface.}

The results show that all these methods give reasonably accurate BE's with B3LYP being slightly better than HF but with both PBE0 and LCBPBE being poorer than HF. A rigorous and general decomposition of core level binding energy values into initial and final state contributions to the BE's is proposed that can be used within either HF or DFT methods. The results show that Koopmans' theorem does not hold for the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues. Consequently, Kohn-Sham orbital energies of core orbitals do not provide estimates of the initial state contribution to core level BE's; hence, they cannot be used to decompose initial and final state contributions to BE's. However, when the initial state contribution to DFT BE's is properly defined, the decompositions of initial and final state contributions given by DFT, with several different functionals, are very similar to those obtained with HF. Furthermore, it is shown that the differences of Kohn-Sham orbital energies taken with respect to a common reference do follow the trend of the properly calculated initial state contributions. These conclusions are especially important for condensed phase systems where our results validate the use of band structure calculations to determine initial state contributions to BE shifts.},

	abstract = {Surface chemical analysis by XPS is more than 60 years old. During the last 15 years ther-e has been an explosive growth in the publication of XPS peak-fits and interpretations. Unfortunately, these publications suffer from a variety of problems in reliability and usefulness because the new authors are not familiar enough with the science and application of XPS, chemical state assignments, and peak-fitting. Efforts to help new users include journal publications such as self-training guides for peak-fitting, international standards, collections of BEs, examples of peak-fitting, and more. These user guides are useful and are published in journals that are known to publish XPS information. The basics of XPS are taught at a few graduate level courses in universities and there are 3--5 day training courses at conferences, but the need is much greater. To help the international XPS community and the infrequent users of XPS to overcome these limitations, problems and needs, The XPS Library™ was formed as a non-profit institute to provide an on-line resource of XPS information, self-training material, free {$>$}70,000 monochromatic XPS reference spectra, free spectral data processing software, reference tables, links, examples of good and bad peak-fitting, and more. In 1986, this author began to build The XPS Spectra-Base™ by collecting and organizing detailed sets of ``self-consistent'' monochromatic XPS spectra from reference materials, natural crystals, man-made single crystals, and commercial products. The current number of individual spectra in digital form is {$>$}70,000 and the number of materials is {$>$}9,000. Each set of spectra (4--10) is stored inside individual data directories having the name of the material analyzed. Multiple data directories belonging to the same category are placed in a directory with the name of that category. Each category name is distinct and is based on the chemistry of the materials. Currently, ``XPS Library'' members must download individual sets of spectra or full directories that are stored in ZIP files. To view, peak-fit, export, analyze, overlay, process, or print the spectra provided by The XPS Spectra-Base the library member needs a software that can import or directly open spectra having: VAMAS-ISO 14,976 ASCII file format, other ASCII file formats (XY, XYZ), or the SDP binary file format. Most software from the instrument makers can import these types of spectra. The ``Spectral Data Processor'' (SDP™) v8.0 is a 32-bit Windows™ (v7 10 compatible) software is provided free of charge to library members. Using SDP v8 the user can: (a) access and open the raw or processed spectra downloaded from The XPS SpectraBase, (b) save all processing results and labels to permanent memory, (c) completely reprocess, peak-fit, analyze, overlay, process, or print the spectra, (d) export or save the raw or processed spectra in VAMAS-ISO ASCII and other ASCII file formats, and (e) import spectra having VAMAS-ISO 14,976 ASCII file format and other ASCII file formats (XY, XYZ). Several thousand High Energy Resolution Auger Electron Spectra (HER-AES) from insulators, conductors, and native oxides will be added. All spectra are owned, copyrighted, and are the property of The XPS Library and are protected by a registered international copyright (TX 4 560-881).},

Gas adsorption on the Ca films at room temperature, both for oxygen and water, is initiated by complete dissociation of the impinging molecules leading to the formation of Ca--O bonds. Exposure to water furthermore leads to the formation of hydroxyl groups via hydrogen abstraction from water forming a complete surface layer. Hydroxyl groups are also formed upon exposure of CaO films to water, but to a significantly smaller amount compared to Ca films exposed to water.},

	abstract = {Core-level energies are frequently calculated to explain the X-ray photoelectron spectra of metal-organic hybrid interfaces. The current paper describes how such simulations can be flawed when modeling interfaces between physisorbed organic molecules and metals. The problem occurs when applying periodic boundary conditions to correctly describe extended interfaces and simultaneously considering core hole excitations in the framework of a final-state approach to account for screening effects. Since the core hole is generated in every unit cell, an artificial dipole layer is formed. In this work, we study methane on an Al(100) surface as a deliberately chosen model system for hybrid interfaces to evaluate the impact of this computational artifact. We show that changing the supercell size leads to artificial shifts in the calculated core-level energies that can be well beyond 1 eV for small cells. The same applies to atoms at comparably large distances from the substrate, encountered, for example, in extended, upright-standing adsorbate molecules. We also argue that the calculated work function change due to a core-level excitation can serve as an indication for the occurrence of such an artifact and discuss possible remedies for the problem.},

The composites were composed of {$\alpha$}-Ca(BH4)2, {$\gamma$}-Ca(BH4)2 and orthorhombic LiBH4, and the relative phase quantities of the Ca(BH4)2 polymorphs varied significantly with LiBH4 content. The formation of small amounts of orthorhombic CaH2 and cubic CaH2 in a CaF2-like structure was observed upon heat treatment. Concurrent formation of elemental boron may also occur. The ionic conductivity of the composites was measured using impedance spectroscopy, and was found to be lower than that of ball milled LiBH4. Electronic band structure calculations indicate that cubic CaH2 with hydrogen defects is electronically conducting. Its formation along with the possible precipitation of boron therefore has an effect on the measured conductivity of the LiBH4--Ca(BH4)2 composites and may increase the risk of an internal short-circuit in the cells.},

	abstract = {With more than 9000 papers published annually, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an indispensable technique in modern surface and materials science for the determination of chemical bonding. The accuracy of chemical-state determination relies, however, on a trustworthy calibration of the binding energy (BE) scale, which is a nontrivial task due to the lack of an internal BE reference. One approach, proposed in the early days of XPS, employs the C 1s spectra of an adventitious carbon layer, which is present on all surfaces exposed to air. Despite accumulating criticism, pointing to the unknown origin and composition of the adventitious carbon, this is by far the most commonly used method today for all types of samples, not necessarily electrically insulating. Alarmingly, as revealed by our survey of recent XPS literature, the calibration procedure based on the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon is highly arbitrary, which results in incorrect spectral interpretation, contradictory results, and generates a large spread in reported BE values for elements even present in the same chemical state. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the status quo of XPS with a historical perspective, provide the technique's operating principles, resolve myths associated with C 1s referencing, and offer a comprehensive account of recent findings. Owing to the huge volume of XPS literature produced each year, the consequences of improper referencing are dramatic. Our intention is to promote awareness within a growing XPS community as to the problems reported over the last six decades and present a guide with best practice for using the C 1s BE referencing method.},

	abstract = {The formation of islands of O-atoms is the dominant mode of growth of the oxide in the first stages of oxidation of Al(1\,1\,1). It is however unknown if a similar mechanism exists for other low index surfaces of Al. We performed a density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics investigation of the first stages of the oxidation of Al(1\,1\,0) using two distinct models: a homogeneous surface disposition of O-atoms; and a model where the O-atoms are close-spaced forming clusters or islands. We investigated the surface reactions with oxygen up to a coverage of 2 ML and found that for both models the adsorption energy per dissociating O2(g) becomes more negative with increasing coverage. Our results show that for coverages up to 1.25 ML the oxide forms clusters or islands while for coverages higher than 1.5 ML the oxide covers the surface homogeneously. This is because the O-atoms bind preferably to neighboring sites even at the minimum coverage. With increasing coverage, the clusters of O start to form stripes along the [1\,1{\textasciimacron}\,0] direction. The work function ({$\phi$}) of the surface decreases when going from bare Al(1\,1\,0) to up to 1 ML coverage of O-atoms, but for coverages of 1.25 ML and higher, {$\phi$} increases. The Al 2p surface core level shifts (SCLS) shift towards higher binding energies with increasing surface coverage of O-atoms and start to approach the values of Al 2p in Al2O3 already at a coverage of 2ML. A relation between the SCLS and the coordination number of Al to O-atoms was made. The Al 2p SCLS increases with increasing coordination to O-atoms, for single, twofold and three-fourfold coordinated cations. For the O-atoms that terminate the surface at the short-bridge sites, the SCLS of O 1s, is largely affected by the proximity to other O-atoms. These results demonstrate that the cooperative effects between surface bound O-atoms have important roles in the mechanism of growth of the oxide at Al(1\,1\,0), and similarly to what happens for Al(1\,1\,1), the initial oxidation of Al(1\,1\,0) proceeds via the formation of islands of O-atoms.},

Before exposure of the cuprite, the Cu 2p photoelectron and Cu L2,3-edge absorption spectra were consistent with CuI with very little d9 character. Surface-enhanced O 1s spectra from the unexposed mineral revealed a surface species, with binding energy 0.95{\textpm}0.05eV below the principal cuprous oxide peak, assigned to under-coordinated oxygen. A second surface species, with binding energy about 1eV higher than the principal peak, was assigned to either hydroxyl derived from chemisorbed water vapour or surface oxygen dimers produced by restructuring of the cuprite fracture surface. The width of the principal O 1s peak was 0.66{\textpm}0.02eV. The observed Cu L3- and O K-edge absorption spectra were in good agreement with those simulated for the cuprite structure. After exposure of the fracture surface to ambient air, the low binding energy O 1s surface species was barely discernible, the original high binding energy O 1s surface species remained of comparable intensity, new intensity appeared at an even higher ({$\sim$}1.9eV) binding energy, and the Cu L2,3-edge spectrum indicated the presence of CuII, consistent with the formation of a thin surface layer of Cu(OH)2.},

The distortion of the surface atoms from the spherical symmetry of the bulk Mg and O atoms is examined by a novel theoretical procedure. The anomalous O SCLS is shown to arise from the increase of the effective size of surface O anions.},

From the early Li-metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li-based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next-generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium-ion battery chemistries.},

In particular, high-energy density lithium-ion batteries are considered as the ideal power source for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in the automotive industry, in recent years. This review discusses key aspects of the present and the future battery technologies on the basis of the working electrode. We then discuss how lithium-ion batteries evolve to meet the growing demand on high charge capacity and electrode stability. An account of a stand-alone energy device (off-grid system) that combines an energy harvesting technology with a lithium-ion battery is also provided. The main discussion is categorized into three perspectives such as the evolution from the conventional to the advanced LIBs (               e.g.               , Li-rich transition metal oxide and Ni-rich transition metal oxide batteries), to the state-of-the-art LIBs (               e.g.               , Li--air, Li--sulfur batteries, organic electrode batteries, solid-state batteries, and Li--CO               2               batteries), and to the hybridized LIBs (               e.g.               , metal halide perovskite batteries).},

The realization of a rechargeable Ca battery technology primarily requires identification and development of suitable electrodes and electrolytes, which is why we here cover the progress starting from the fundamental electrode/electrolyte requirements, concepts, materials, and compositions employed and finally a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art, allowing us to conclude with the particular roadblocks still existing. As for crucial breakthroughs, reversible plating and stripping of calcium at the metal-anode interface was achieved only recently and for very specific electrolyte formulations. Therefore, while much of the current research aims at finding suitable cathodes to achieve proof-of-concept for a full Ca battery, the spectrum of electrolytes researched is also expanded. Compatibility of cell components is essential, and to ensure this, proper characterization is needed, which requires design of a multitude of reliable experimental setups and sometimes methodology development beyond that of other next generation battery technologies. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future strategies to make best use of the current advances in materials science combined with computational design, electrochemistry, and battery engineering, all to propel the Ca battery technology to reality and ultimately reach its full potential for energy storage.},

Given the low redox potential of metallic calcium, its surface is commonly covered by a passivation layer grown by the accumulation of electrolyte decomposition products. The presence of borate species in this layer has been shown to be a key parameter allowing for Ca2+ migration and favoring Ca electrodeposition. Here, boron-based additives are evaluated in order to tune the SEI composition, morphology, and properties. The decomposition of a BF3-based additive is studied at different potentiostatic steps and the resulting SEI layer was thoroughly characterized. SEI growth mechanism is proposed based on both experimental data and DFT calculations pointing at the formation of boron-crosslinked polymeric matrices. Several boron-based adducts are explored as SEI-forming additives for calcium-metal batteries paving the way to very rich chemistry leading to Ca2+ conducting SEI.},

In Ca-metal batteries, suitable electrolyte and interphase are necessary to achieve reversible calcium plating/stripping, which is challenging for F-based salts at room temperature. Ion transport and charge transfer in calcium batteries with Ca(BF4)2-NaPF6 electrolyte are regulated for the first time by altering solvent and salt categories and ratios, achieving adjustable interphase species and microstructure, calcium deposition/dissolution overpotentials, and cycling stability. The optimized electrolyte of 0.1 m Ca(BF4)2-0.9 m NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (7:1:6:6, v/v) contributes to the most stable Ca plating/stripping cycling and the weakest overpotential, as well as Na/Ca-based hybrid solid electrolyte interphases including proper amount of organic matter. Ca-metal batteries with the optimized electrolyte achieve an ultrahigh reversible capacity of {$\approx$}290 mAh g-1 (at 200 mA g-1 and 1.2--4.5 V), almost four times more than that of counterpart ones ({$\approx$}65 mAh g-1), equivalent to energy/power performance of {$\approx$}616 Wh kg-1 at 429 W kg-1 among the best ones for multivalent ion rechargeable metal batteries.},

SEI is crucial to battery performance because it plays a vital role to determine the Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, capacity, and safety.

This review is dedicated to critical discussion on recent advances in understanding the formation mechanisms of SEI. The important factors, including electrolyte components, temperature, areal current, and electrode materials, that affect the formation, morphology, structure, composition, and properties of SEI layers are discussed. In situ/operando characterization techniques used to look into the surface morphology, electrochemical performance, chemical composition, structure, and mechanical properties of SEI layers are emphasized. The recent progress of the state-of-the-art cryogenic electron microscopy aimed at atomistic visualization of SEI is highlighted. Multi-scale theoretical simulations employed to study the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of SEI are also discussed. In addition, the SEIs formed on various anodes using solid-state electrolytes are also presented. Finally, the outstanding challenges and future directions in understanding SEI are presented.

A statistical analysis comparing with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments shows that BEs estimations are very accurate, TPSS exhibiting the best performance. Considering {$\Delta$}BEs, the three methods yield very similar and excellent results, with mean absolute deviations of {$\sim$}0.25 eV. When considering relativistic effects, BEs deviations drop approaching experimental values. So, the largest mean percentage deviation is of 0.25\% only. Linear trends among experimental and estimated values have been found, gaining offsets with respect to ideality. By adding relativistic effects to offsets, HF and TPSS methods underestimate experimental values by solely 0.11 and 0.05 eV, respectively, well within XPS chemical precision. TPSS is posed as an excellent choice for the characterization, by XPS, of molecules on metal solid substrates, given its suitability in describing metal substrates bonds and atomic and/or molecular orbitals.},

To achieve this goal, several theoretical considerations are necessary beyond just the calculation of XPS BEs. Though briefly discussed here, we are not primarily interested in absolute values of BE or quantitation using relative intensities. Within the molecular orbital (MO) theory framework, it is shown that the analysis of orbital properties is critical for the correct interpretation of XPS. In particular, rigorous definitions are given for the initial state and final state contributions to BEs and to BE shifts, {$\Delta$}BE. It is first shown how the BEs of core levels are related to the electronic structure by consideration of the BEs for a model atomic system to establish the origins and magnitudes of BE shifts. The mechanisms established for the model system are then applied to a review of XPS measurements and MO theory on a set of real examples. An important focus of the paper is to demonstrate that, in many cases, initial state mechanisms allow for a definitive interpretation of the XPS BE shifts and that an important role of theory is to provide qualitative explanations rather than quantitative agreement with XPS measurements. The mechanisms established are a guide to the interpretation of XPS measurements and consideration of these mechanisms may suggest additional calculations that would be useful. It is concluded that there is still a bright future for the coupling of ab initio MO theory with XPS measurements.},

Using exemplary molecules in gas-phase, in bulk crystals, and at metal--organic interfaces, we systematically assess how practical simulation choices affect the stability and accuracy of simulations. These include the choice of exchange--correlation functional, basis set, the method of core-hole localization, and the use of periodic boundary conditions (PBC). We particularly focus on the choice of aperiodic or periodic description of systems and how spurious charge effects in periodic calculations affect the simulation outcomes.

	abstract = {After a brief recapitulation of the historic development of photoelectron spectroscopy, we review the attempts to interpret, in particular, x-ray photoelectron spectra to extract information on electronic structure and constitution, i.e. stoichiometry of materials systems. We focus on materials systems, specifically in the area of heterogeneous catalysis, and modelling their complexity by designing single crystal-based model systems with well-defined structures. This allows us to relate measured chemical shifts observed in X-ray photoelectron spectra, obtained with both laboratory and synchrotron radiation, to structures and also allows us to test those against theory. We discuss a number of systems by combing experimental observations and theory and demonstrate the usefulness of combined theory/experiment approach. We also point out a number of issues, that are often ignored in previous and present studies published in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.},

	abstract = {DFT calculations show that the core level shift (CLS) of the S 2p binding energy of thiol and sulfur atoms on different thiol--Pd(111) surfaces strongly depends on the adsorbed or subsurface state of sulfur atoms.           ,              Thiol molecules on planar metal surfaces are widely used for building sensing and electronic devices and also as capping agents to protect and to control the size and shape of nanoparticles. In the case of Pd the thiol molecules exhibit a complex behavior because C--S bond scission is possible, resulting in a significant amount of co-adsorbed S. Therefore identification of these species on Pd is a key point for many applications, a task that is usually achieved by XPS. Here we show, from DFT calculations, that the core level shift (CLS) of the S 2p binding energy (BE) of thiol and sulfur on different thiol--Pd(111) surface models strongly depends on the adsorbed or subsurface state of sulfur atoms. Our results reflect the complexity of S 2p BE behavior and contribute to understanding and reanalyzing the experimental data of thiolated Pd surfaces.},

We find a major change of the molecular backbone resulting in a peculiar V-shape bending, due to the direct anchoring of the two central carbons atop two Al atoms underneath. In the most stable adsorption configuration, pentacene is oriented with the long axis parallel to the substrate [110] direction, where such anchoring is favored by optimally matched interatomic distances. Remarkably, due to the generally low degree of order, we measure by STM a significant portion of molecules oriented along the [100] direction, which also display the same V-shape conformation, as driven by the bond of the central carbon atoms of pentacene to a pair of slightly displaced Al atoms.},

	abstract = {Calcium ion batteries are gaining attention as alternatives to lithium-ion technology because they offer comparable properties at reduced cost and improved safety. However, progress has been limited because of the inability to efficiently and reversibly plate and strip Ca metal anodes in organic electrolytes. Moreover, the inorganic components of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) that form via decomposition of the electrolyte often do not allow for the diffusion of Ca ions. In this work, an approach combining density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations is utilized to show that the use of a preformed artificial SEI layer of amorphous Al2O3 can potentially prevent electrolyte decomposition. First, Ca is shown to be able to intercalate into an amorphous Al2O3 layer (up to Ca1.5Al2O3) and diffuse through on a reasonable time scale. Through calculation of the density of states, the system is found to remain insulating up to the equilibrium stoichiometry. Finally, AIMD simulations with a realistic organic electrolyte environment are used to show that this calcinated Al2O3 layer completely prevents the decomposition of solvent molecules. This approach can provide a route to efficient rechargeable Ca ion batteries, paving the way for cheap large-scale energy storage.},

	abstract = {The electrochemical activity of solvated Ca2+ in glyme-based electrolytes is investigated using grand canonical density functional theory approach and Fukui functions. The obtained results reveal that the length of glyme molecules has little effect on the reduction potentials, but has significant impacts on the effective electron transfer process. In short chain glymes, the transferred electron is located on a Ca2+ center and the organic part of the solvation sphere, leading to a direct Ca2+ reduction and a partial degradation of the glyme molecules. As the glyme's length increases, the reduction process turns into the formation of solvated electrons rather than Ca2+ reduction, unless a partial desolvation occurs. Consequently, an effective Ca2+ reduction in long chain glyme-based electrolytes is controlled by a (partial) desolvation of the solvation sphere. These results can be used as guiding information to design new electrolytes having the Ca2+ reduction potential in an accessible voltage range together with an effective Ca2+ reduction process. The methodology developed in this study can be universally applied to investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of other battery systems using metal anodes, which might lead to a paradigm shift in the design of prospective electrolytes for future battery technologies.},
