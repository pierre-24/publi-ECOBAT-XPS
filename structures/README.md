This dataset contains the optimized structures of the nitroxides, as VASP (POSCAR) files

The different structures are organized as following:

+ `molecules/C185/`: contains the structures (after optimization) from [the C185 data set of N. Pueyo Bellafont](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.24704),
+ `molecules/adsorbates/`: contains the structures adsorbates (a-j in Fig. 1) of the paper,
+ `slabs/{composition}_slab/`: contains the slabs of increasing thickness, `{composition}` can be `Ca`, `CaO`, `CaO_OH2`, or `CaH2`, and
+ `slabs_adsorbate/{composition}_slab/`: contains the structures of the slab+adsorbate systems.
