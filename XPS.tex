	Understanding the spectroscopic signatures of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) components is crucial for advancing calcium-based batteries, as the SEI composition directly impacts the performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a key technique for probing surface chemistry, yet fundamental studies on binding energies of SEI-grafted molecules remain limited. Additionally, accurately computing XPS chemical shifts for surfaces and adsorbates while balancing precision and cost is a challenge.
	This work employs density functional theory (DFT) with periodic boundary conditions to investigate the adsorption of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and its degradation products on calcium surfaces, including metallic Ca, CaO, and \ce{CaH2}. A fully hydroxylated CaO surface is also considered. Two primary interaction mechanisms are identified: (i) adsorption via unsaturated carbon atoms and (ii) proton transfer from alcohol groups to CaO. After evaluating various computational approaches, the Slater-Janak scheme is adopted to compute the XPS spectra for O 1s, C 1s, and Ca 2s. Significant shifts in oxygen and carbon binding energies are observed, while these of calcium remain largely unchanged. These findings provide valuable insights into SEI formation and offer useful trends for interpreting XPS spectra, with good agreement observed between simulations and available experimental data.

\section{Introduction}

Batteries represent a crucial technology for the transition to a climate-neutral society. Since their market introduction, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have evolved into a highly mature technology, currently utilized in a wide range of applications.\cite{zubiLithiumionBatteryState2018,kimLithiumionBatteriesOutlook2019} Despite their established performance, LIBs face significant limitations that hinder their suitability for large-scale applications, primarily due to different fundamental issues, one of them being the insufficient energy density.\cite{luReviewKeyIssues2013,li30YearsLithiumIon2018} Addressing this point can be achieved through the use of divalent cations, such as \ce{Ca^2+}.\cite{arroyo-dedompabloAchievementsChallengesProspects2020,taghavi-kahaghPoweringFutureComprehensive2024} However, its high reactivity demands the design of specialized electrolytes to support a reversible mechanism. Additionally, detailed insight into the chemistry of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) remains crucial.\cite{melemedImpactDifferentialCa22023,zhaoRevealingSolidElectrolyte2022}
In the literature, calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) utilize electrolytes such as dimethyl ether (DME), ethylene carbonate (EC), glyme, or tetrahydrofuran (THF), often in combination with weakly coordinating anions like \ce{BH4-} or \ce{BF4-} \cite{songElectrolyteOptimizationInterphase2022,zhaoRevealingSolidElectrolyte2022,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023}. 
Both experimental \cite{songElectrolyteOptimizationInterphase2022,melemedImpactDifferentialCa22023,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023} and quantum chemistry studies \cite{hahnCriticalRoleConfigurational2020,liepinyaComputationalComparisonEther2021,yamijalaStabilityCalciumIon2021} have explored SEI formation, typically focusing on the degradation pathways arising from the interactions between calcium, the electrolyte, and coordinating anions\cite{wuUnderstandingSolidElectrolyte2021,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023}. While these studies provide valuable insights, the comparison between experimental spectroscopic data and simulated spectra is an important aspect that can significantly enhance the understanding, both at the experimental and theoretical level.


X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive, quantitative spectroscopy that allows for the identification of elements of molecules in different environments.\cite{brigianoPeculiarOpportunitiesGiven2022} It belongs to the family of photoemission spectroscopies, where the kinetic energy of electrons emitted by the photoelectric effect is analyzed. Specifically, XPS uses a beam of soft X-rays ($\SI{100}{\electronvolt} < h\nu < \SI{10}{\kilo\electronvolt}$), enabling to probe core electrons (low principal quantum number).\cite{stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020} The conservation of energy is described by the equation:
\begin{equation}
	h\nu = \text{BE} + E_{\text{kin}} + \phi, \label{eq:xps}
\end{equation}
where BE is the binding energy of the electron, $E_{\text{kin}}$ is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron (measured by the detector), and $\phi$ is the work function, which accounts for surface effects and detector contributions. Using a source of monochromatic X-rays (such as Al $K_\alpha$, $h\nu = \SI{1486.7}{\electronvolt}$), it is possible to determine BE from $E_{\text{kin}}$ \cite{stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020}. The binding energy depends on how tightly the electron is bound in its orbital, making it sensitive to the oxidation state and to the chemical environment of the originating atom. It is routinely used experimentally to gain understanding on the SEI composition of both LIBs and CIBs \cite{forero-saboyaUnderstandingNaturePassivation2020a,songElectrolyteOptimizationInterphase2022,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023,melemedImpactDifferentialCa22023,linDecipheringDynamicInterfacial2024}. However, to the best of our knowledge, while there have been some theoretical studies for the SEI of LIBs via the simulation of the XPS spectra\cite{ebadiInsightsLiMetalOrganic2019}, none exists for CIBs.

Therefore, this study explores the XPS spectra related to the degradation and polymerization of THF, using it as a model system. Several potential degradation products (Fig.~\ref{fig:THFdegradation}), along with the polymerization into poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (PTMEG), are investigated on various calcium substrates, including calcium oxide and calcium hydride. These molecules are chosen in order to consider different relevant chemical moieties. Following a review of the theoretical methods and the computational details, the results are presented: first, the different methods for calculating binding energies are evaluated, and then, the geometries of the adsorbed molecules along with their adsorption energies are scrutinized. Finally, the core of the paper is the analysis of the simulated XPS spectra.

\section{Theoretical methods}\label{sec:theo}

From a quantum chemistry perspective, the binding energy (here for core electrons) is akin to the ionization energy:
\begin{equation}
	\text{BE}_i = E^{N-1}_i(\text{final}) - E^{N}(\text{initial}), \label{eq:dscf}
\end{equation}
where $E^{N}$ and $E^{N-1}_i$ are the energies of the initial $N$-electron non-ionized state and the final $N-1$ electron ionized state with a electron hole on atom $i$. While these energies could be obtained through (relativistic) multi-configuration approaches, this is impractical for large systems. Even CIS or TD-DFT based calculations of excitation energies are challenging, as they correspond to highly excited states \cite{vinesPredictionCoreLevel2018}.

For gas-phase molecules, classical quantum chemistry tools can be utilized. At the HF level, BE's can be approximated using Koopmans' theorem, which correlates BE's to the orbital energy of the removed electron. This is known as the initial state (IS) or frozen orbitals (FO) approach.\cite{pueyobellafontPredictionCoreLevel2015} However, electronic relaxation effects are neglected. More accurate values can be obtained using Eq.~\eqref{eq:dscf}, by computing the energy difference between initial and final states at the HF level, known as the $\Delta$SCF approach, which includes final state (FS) effects. While this method may provide quantitative agreement in some cases, electron correlation effects are significant, necessitating the use of density functional theory (DFT), for which Koopmans' theorem no longer applies \cite{pueyobellafontPredictionCoreLevel2015,pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017,kleinNutsBoltsCorehole2021}. Correlated wavefunction methods are also an alternative but they suffer from prohibitive computational costs for the type of systems considered here.

Treating solids or surfaces adds further complexity.\cite{garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012,bagusXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2024} Generally, only valence levels are explicitly treated, with pseudopotentials (PPs) modeling core electrons. The projected augmented wave (PAW) method maps results to all-electron wavefunctions using carefully designed PPs and transformations\cite{blochlProjectorAugmentedwaveMethod1994}. A core hole can then be generated, neglecting the relaxation of other core electrons but including valence electron relaxation\cite{garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012}. This however limits the accuracy of absolute BE descriptions.
A complementary challenge arises due to the use of periodic boundary conditions (PBC), since the hole is periodically repeated, creating an infinitely charged system. Two approaches can address this: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item adding the excited electron to the bottom of the conduction band (CBM or LUMO for isolated molecules), or 
	\item removing the excited electron from the system and using a background counter-charge.
\end{inparaenum}
The first approach underestimates BE's, resembling excitation energies of absorption processes, while the second induces physically incorrect effects, further complicating absolute BE prediction.\cite{olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006,garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012,pueyobellafontPerformanceTPSSFunctional2016,pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017,taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}

However, relative BE can be estimated from computing wavefunctions and energies for a fractional number of electrons using Slater transition state theory and Janak's theorem \cite{janakProofThatFrac1978}, resulting in the Slater-Janak (SJ) approach \cite{hiraoImprovedSlaterTransition2021}. In this approach, BE's are computed with a half-electron removed from orbital $i$ and placed either in the conduction band or in the vacuum, referred to as the SJ and SJ\textsuperscript{n} approaches\cite{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017}, respectively (Fig.~\ref{fig:method}). The advantages and limitations of these methods remain a topic of ongoing debate in the literature\cite{olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006,taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}. Nevertheless, they have been widely applied, particularly the SJ approach, in the study of surfaces\cite{olovssonFirstPrincipleCalculations2010,bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019,bagusXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2024} and adsorbates on surfaces\cite{babyAnchoringBendingPentacene2015,salvarezzaExploringCoreLevel2015,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}.

After the calculation, the corresponding eigenvalue, $\varepsilon_i\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, is extracted. The binding energy is then calculated as:
\begin{equation}
	\text{BE}_i = 
	E_{ref}- \varepsilon_i\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right), \label{eq:xpsbe}
\end{equation}
where $E_{ref}$ is a reference energy, chosen to ensure consistency across systems. Different choices exist in the literature, and thus this study considers several choices for $E_{ref}$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $E_{ref}=0$, thus using only the orbital energy,
	\item $E_{ref}=E_F$, where the Fermi energy $E_F$ is used, 
	\item $E_{ref}=E_\infty$, the vacuum energy, calculated by taking the electrostatic potential in the vacuum region of the cell (when dipole correction are included, the vacuum potential is not equal on both sides of the slab, and so the potential is taken on the side corresponding to the core-hole \cite{montiInfluenceElectrostaticFields2010}),
	\item $E_{ref}=\phi =  E_\infty - E_F$, where the work function of the system is considered\cite{kahnFermiLevelWork2015}, and
	\item $E_{ref}= \varepsilon_{ref}$, where $\varepsilon_{ref}$ is the orbital energy of another atom in the cell. Although it might seem reasonable to use calcium, which is present in all slabs, this approach would depend on the slab's nature and it would not be possible for gas-phase molecules. To overcome this, an Argon atom (to mimic calcium) is placed in the vacuum region, and $\varepsilon_{ref}=\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, computing a binding energy for a given atom requires to select a computational protocol, which includes the choice of a  way to deal with the electron reorganization  (in this work, SJ or SJ\textsuperscript{n}), and a $E_{ref}$.
It should, however, be noted that extracting $E_\infty$ is not feasible for bulk systems, where no vacuum region exists, or for charged systems, where the electrostatic potential is not constant in the vacuum region. This latter condition occurs when employing the SJ\textsuperscript{n} method. Nevertheless, it is possible to correct the Fermi level energy to remove the impact of the background of charge, as discussed in Ref.~\citenum{lozovoiInitioSimulationCharged2001}. This possibility is referred to as $E_{ref}=E_F'$, where $E_F' = E_F - \max\{E_{elst}(z)\}$, with $E_{elst}(z)$ being the planar average of the electrostatic potential along the $z$ axis. It is generally maximal in the center of the vacuum region. 
Note that other corrective schemes have recently been reported in the literature \cite{freysoldtFirstprinciplesCalculationsCharged2018,freysoldtGeneralizedDipoleCorrection2020,chagasdasilvaSelfConsistentPotentialCorrection2021,rutterChargedSurfacesSlabs2021}. These methods are typically integrated directly into the (Kohn-Sham) self-consistent field iterative procedure, offering improved accuracy compared to the post-hoc corrections employed in this work. However, the implementation of such schemes in VASP lies beyond the scope of the present study.

Finally, while the determination of absolute binding energies (BE) is challenging from a theoretical perspective, the measurement or calculation of the work function, $\phi$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:xps}, is also complex. As a result, both experimentalists and quantum chemists often focus on the relative binding energy, $\Delta\text{BE}$, which is the difference in binding energy for a given atom with respect  to that in a reference compound \cite{vinesPredictionCoreLevel2018,stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020,greczynskiXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2020}. In this contribution, relative BE values are computed as:\begin{equation}
	\Delta\text{BE}_i = \text{BE}_i - \text{BE}(\text{ref}), \label{eq:dbe}
\end{equation} 
using the calculated or experimental BE values for \ce{CH4}, \ce{NH3}, \ce{H2O}, \ce{B2H6}, and \ce{HF} as references for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, boron, and fluorine, respectively. The experimental values are taken from Ref.~\citenum{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017}. For calcium, the value for bulk Ca in CaO is used, taken from the XPS library \cite{cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a} (computationally, a  2x2 slab containing 16 layers is used).

	
\section{Computational details}\label{sec:comp}

All calculations (geometry optimizations and binding energies) were performed  with VASP (version 6.4.1) using DFT with the PBE exchange-correlation functional, the D3 dispersion correction, and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method.\cite{blochlProjectorAugmentedwaveMethod1994} The energy  (per unit cell) convergence criterion was set to \SI{e-4}{\electronvolt}, with a cutoff of \SI{550}{\electronvolt} for the kinetic energy of the plane waves. Gaussian smearing of the energy of valence electrons, with a width of \SI{0.2}{\electronvolt}, was applied.  Fermi energies were thus computed with \texttt{EFERMI = MIDGAP} in the VASP input. Brillouin zone integration was performed at the $\Gamma$-point for molecules in gas phase, using a 4x4x4 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh\cite{monkhorstSpecialPointsBrillouinzone1976} for bulk calculations, and a 4x4x1 mesh for slab calculations. Note that the values for the cutoff energy and k-point mesh grid were chosen after convergence tests (Fig.~S2), while also ensuring a balance between accuracy and computational cost. The \texttt{Ca\_sv} pseudopotential\cite{blochlProjectorAugmentedwaveMethod1994,kresseUltrasoftPseudopotentialsProjector1999} was employed to model calcium.

\subsection{Geometry optimization} 
All optimizations were carried out using the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno  (L-BFGS) algorithm, driven by the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package \cite{larsenAtomicSimulationEnvironment2017}, using VASP energies and forces as inputs, until the force on all atoms was below \SI{e-2}{\electronvolt\per\angstrom}.

In gas phase, each molecule was placed in a cubic box with a side length of \SI{20}{\angstrom} (with the molecule center of mass placed at the origin) and  its geometry was optimized with frozen cell parameters.

In order to build slabs, bulk \ce{Ca^0} (from the Material Project, \texttt{MP-45}), CaO (\texttt{MP-2605}), and \ce{CaH2} (\texttt{MP-23713}) were selected, and their atomic positions and cell parameters were optimized. Subsequently, to determine the optimal surface orientation, 1x1 slabs with increasing thickness along different low-index orientations [(100), (110), and (111)] were constructed using ASE \cite{larsenAtomicSimulationEnvironment2017}. They have been constructed to ensure non-polar surfaces. The slabs were relaxed with the central two layers frozen to mimic bulk conditions, with the distance between slab repetitions set to 10 times the $c$ cell parameter of the bulk. For each orientation, the surface energy $\gamma^{hkl}$ was calculated by least-squares fitting of the following expression \cite{sunEfficientCreationConvergence2013,tranSurfaceEnergiesElemental2016}:
\begin{equation}
	E^{hkl}(N) = E_0\,N + 2A\,\gamma^{hkl} \label{eq:surf}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of layers in the slab, $A$ is the slab surface area, $E^{hkl}(N)$ is the energy of the relaxed slab cut along $(hkl)$, and $E_0$ approximates the energy of one (bulk) layer. The results (Table \ref{tab:surf}, Fig.~S3) indicate that (100) surfaces are the most energetically favorable, consistently with the literature \cite{deleeuwDensityFunctionalTheory2000,ebadiInsightsLiMetalOrganic2019}. 

\begin{table}
	\caption{Surface energies ($\gamma^{hkl}$, in \si{\joule\per\meter\squared}) of Ca, CaO, and \ce{CaH2} slabs along different orientations, as determined through Eq.~\eqref{eq:surf} using the $N$ values given in parentheses.}
	\label{tab:surf}
	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
		\toprule
		&	\ce{Ca^0} & \ce{CaO} &	\ce{CaH2} \\
		\midrule
		(100) & 0.555 ($N\in[6,16]$) & 0.470 ($N\in[6,16]$) & 0.871  ($N\in[12,32]$)\\
		(110) & 0.630  ($N\in[6,16]$)& 1.777  ($N\in[6,16]$)& 1.109 ($N\in[12,32]$)\\
		(111) & 0.563  ($N\in[6,16]$) & 4.080  ($N\in[5,15]$)  & 1.117   ($N\in[12,32]$) \\ 
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Thus, using these (100) orientation, 3x3 (\ce{Ca^0} and CaO) and 2x2 (\ce{CaH2}) slabs (ensuring a slab surface of $\sim 10\times \SI{10}{\angstrom}$) consisting of 6 layers, with a vacuum of \SI{20}{\angstrom} between two slab repetitions were created and relaxed (with frozen cell parameters). 
Additionally, given that it was reported to be favorable\cite{deleeuwDensityFunctionalTheory2000,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a}, the adsorption of water on the CaO surface was investigated. In fact, the contamination of CaO by surface hydroxyls has been reported in many experiments\cite{dupinSystematicXPSStudies2000,bebenseeAdsorptionOxygenWater2008,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}. It is also found for other (oxidized) metallic surfaces\cite{tielensDFTStudyWater2006,truflandierDFTNMRInvestigation51V2010,tougertiStructureCleanHydrated2011}  and has a large impact on their properties. Thus, an additional slab with full coverage (1 water molecule per surface Ca), denoted as \ce{CaO.H_2O}, was built and its geometry was also optimized. 

Finally, compounds \textbf{a}--\textbf{j} (Fig.~\ref{fig:THFdegradation}) were positioned on both sides of the slabs (to avoid the formation of surface dipole), initially placed approximately \SI{6}{\angstrom} from the surface. A final geometry optimization was then performed, keeping the cell parameters and the two inner layers fixed.

\subsection{Binding energies} 

VASP allows targeting a specific orbital, $i$, by removing half an electron from it. For SJ calculation, dipole corrections (using the \texttt{IDIPOL} keyword) are included. For SJ\textsuperscript{n} calculations, it is necessary to adjust the total number of valence electrons (by default, half an electron is added, Fig.~\ref{fig:method}) using the \texttt{NELECT} keyword. Since it is not possible to account for spin-orbit coupling in such calculations, the study is limited to 1s and 2s binding energies. To simulate a spectrum, a Gaussian function centered at each computed \dbe{} is used. Unless otherwise specified, a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt} is employed.

To evaluate the accuracy of the different computational protocols (SJ and SJ\textsuperscript{n} methods, as well as the choice of $E_{ref}$), two sets of calculations were conducted. First, the results from Pueyo Bellafont \textit{et al.} \cite{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017}, which compare experimental and theoretical gas-phase \dbe{} values (computed at the same level of approximation as in this study, but with $E_{ref}=0$), were replicated. Their dataset includes 184 experimental absolute binding energies (BE's) from 68 molecules, covering carbon ($N=107$), nitrogen ($N=20$), oxygen ($N=22$), boron ($N=20$), and fluorine ($N=15$) atoms (Fig.~S1). Each molecule was placed in a cubic box with a side length of \SI{20}{\angstrom}, centered at the molecule's center of mass. The \dbe{} values were then computed for each atom of interest. Other parameters, such as the vacuum energy, were extracted from the density (\texttt{CHGCAR}) and potential (\texttt{LOCPOT}) files. For calculations involving an additional argon atom, it was positioned at the center of the box.

In parallel, the effect of slab thickness was examined using the bare slabs of increasing thickness described above. Binding energies were calculated on 2x2 slabs with a (100) orientation, separated by an interslab distance of \SI{20}{\angstrom}. The geometries were based on the optimized 1x1 slabs from the surface energy study, with a supercell created and then adjusting the interslab spacing. The \dbe{} values were computed for each atom of interest, and the relevant parameters were extracted accordingly. For calculations involving an additional argon atom, it was placed in the vacuum region, either away from the molecule (single molecule case) or between the slabs.

Finally, the \dbe{} values were calculated for each atom of interest in the molecules grafted onto the various surfaces, using the selected reference energy. It is important to note that, in these calculations with the SJ protocol, the relatively small surface area of the slabs could introduce artifacts due to the periodic repetition of core holes in close proximity, especially for adsorbates that are far from the surface.\cite{taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020} This is however partially mitigated when reporting relative rather than absolute BE's and using dipole corrections.

\subsection{Selection of a computational protocol for binding energies}\label{sec:proto}

\subsubsection{Molecules in gas phase}

A comparison between experimental and computed \dbe{} values for carbon is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:xps_C185_C}. Within the SJ\textsuperscript{n} approach, consistent with previous study\cite{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017}, the \cpx[n]{0} protocol provides reliable results for all atoms, exhibiting a very small mean error and an acceptable standard deviation. However, achieving this level of agreement requires using a reference per atom (Table S1) because the difference between experimental and computed absolute BE's increases with the atomic number. A similar observation was done in 2016 by Walter \textit{et al.}\cite{walterOffsetcorrectedKohnShamScheme2016} 
Then, using the \cpx[n]{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}} approach results also in small errors, which is consistent with the observation of Garcià-Gil \textit{et al.}\cite{garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012} (although they only used IS calculations). Across the entire set of 184 \dbe{} values, the combination of either $E_{ref}=0$ or $E_{ref}=\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}$ with the SJ\textsuperscript{n} approach yields comparable results (Fig.~\ref{fig:xps_C185}). 
The precision achieved in this work is comparable to that obtained with the  $\Delta$SCF\cite{golzeAccurateAbsoluteRelative2020,kleinNutsBoltsCorehole2021} or $\Delta$KS\cite{vandenbosscheEffectsNonlocalExchange2014,garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012,walterOffsetcorrectedKohnShamScheme2016} approaches, although caution is advised when employing the latter\cite{pueyobellafontPredictionCoreLevel2015}. GW calculations offer even further enhanced accuracy\cite{golzeAccurateAbsoluteRelative2020}, but their computational cost can be prohibitive for solid-state systems\cite{leiGaussianbasedQuasiparticleSelfconsistent2022}. An alternative route to achieve a better precision would be to use hybrid XC functionals, but this is, again, cost-intensive for solid-state calculations and to the best of ours knowledge, this has not been attempted in the literature.

In contrast, the use of other reference energies significantly degrades the accuracy of the predicted gas-phase \dbe{}. The largest errors are observed when using the Fermi energy \cpx[n]{E_F}, or \cpx [n]{E_F'}, and it leads to underestimated \dbe{} values. 
Turning more specifically to the SJ approach, \cpx{E_F} also gives large errors with large standard deviation, then \cpx{0}, \cpx{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}}, and \cpx{E_\infty} perform similarly, and finally, the lowest error found when using \cpx{\phi}, although it remains substantial. Moreover, all reference energies combined with the SJ protocol tend to overestimate the \dbe{} values. One possible reason is that placing a (half) electron in the LUMO of a molecule significantly alters its electronic structure (Fig.~S4), often more so than the interaction of the core-hole itself, which appears to be better captured by the SJ\textsuperscript{n} approach.\cite{taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020} Other potential reasons include possible mis-alignment of the Fermi energy for the neutral and core-hole containing systems, and an approximate definition of the vacuum energy for isolated molecules.

\subsubsection{Bare slabs}

The situation differs for the bare slabs. The impact of slab thickness ($N$) on the Ca 2s binding energy, evaluated using both protocols, is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:slabsthicknessSJ}-\ref{fig:slabsthicknessSJn}. The results reveal a substantial difference (exceeding \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt} for certain reference energies) between the surface layers (defined as the first and last layers of the slab) and the bulk \dbe{}. With all protocols, BE(surface Ca 2s) $>$ BE(bulk Ca 2s). The difference between bulk and surface BE's are referred to as surface-core level shifts (SCLS),\cite{olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006,bagusChemicalSignificanceXray2023} which have been reported for metals\cite{aldenInitioSurfaceCorelevel1993,weinertCorelevelShiftsBulk1995,olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006} and oxides\cite{harmerSpeciesFormedCuprite2009,calatayudExploringMetalOxides2011,lousadaFirstStagesOxide2018,bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019,cristinadeoliveiraRoleSurfacesMagnetic2021,silvalucenademedeirosAMoO3MicroNanoparticles2024}. One of the main cause of this difference is the difference in chemical environment between bulk and surface atoms, further enhanced by change in Madelung energy between the bulk and surface atoms\cite{nelinSurfaceCorelevelBinding2014}, though this is not the only effect\cite{bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019,bagusChemicalSignificanceXray2023,bagusXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2024}. 
Note that these figures also display the standard deviation ($\sigma$), which measures the variation of BE's within bulk and surface values (Figs.~S5-S6). For the surface layer, this standard deviation is expected to be small, as all atoms are in a similar environment, while it is moderate for bulk values (here, it is generally $<\SI{0.1}{\electronvolt}$) due to differences in atomic environments based on the $z$-position. The standard deviation should also increase with the number of layers ($N$). However, for certain calculations, particularly those with $E_{ref}=\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}$ (and some other methods using the thickest slabs), the variation becomes significant and disrupts the expected trends. Values of mean BE's with $\sigma > \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt}$, which appears erroneous, were therefore excluded from the graphs.


Another key observation is that slab thickness influences some results more than others. For calculations with \cpx{E_F}, \cpx[n]{E_F}, \cpx{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}}, and \cpx{E_\infty}, the predicted values remain nearly constant as $N/N_0$ ($N_0$ is the number of layer in the unit cell) increases. Conversely, other protocols (such as \cpx{0}, \cpx[n]{0}, \cpx{\phi}, or \cpx[n]{E_F'}) appear very sensitive to the system size, with variations of the order of \SI{1}{\electronvolt} from $N/N_0=4$ to 8. 

For O 1s, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:slabOH2}, where simulated XPS spectra for CaO and \ce{CaO.H2O} (both with 6 layers) are shown  (values are also provided in Tables S2-S3), the distinction between bulk and surface contributions is noticeable. In the case of CaO, BE(bulk O 1s in CaO) $\geq$ BE(surface O 1s in CaO), whereas in \ce{CaO.H2O}, the reverse trend is observed, consistent across all protocols. Furthermore, BE(bulk O 1s in CaO) $\approx$ BE(bulk O 1s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) (difference of \SI{0.3}{\electronvolt} or smaller) when using \cpx{E_F}, \cpx{E_\infty}, \cpx[n]{E_F}, or \cpx{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}}. However, the latter yields unreliable results, as evidenced by the spurious peak at \dbe{} = \SI{0}{\electronvolt} in the O 1s spectra, suggesting an artificial differentiation between hydroxyl environments that is not reflected when using other reference energies. Finally,  BE(surface O 1s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) $>$ BE(hydroxyl O 1s  in \ce{CaO.H2O}), but the difference ranges from 0.1 (\textit{e.g.}, \cpx{E_\infty}) to \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt} (\cpx[n]{E_F'}). This latter results was also found by Fujimori \emph{et al.} \cite{fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a} via calculations using a similar method to ours (and \cpx{E_\infty}), which also showed that the separation between these two BE's depends on the hydroxyl coverage of the surface.

\end{figure}

Experimentally, XPS spectra for calcium metal slabs and their oxides, including Ca 2s binding energies, are scarce. Some values from various sources are summarized in Table S4. To the best of our knowledge, no measurements have been reported for \ce{CaH2}, and data for other peaks are limited \cite{franzenXPSSpectraCrystalline1977,sveinbjornssonIonicConductivityFormation2014}. Moreover, due to calcium's high reactivity, contamination by oxides, hydroxyls, and hydrocarbons complicates the analysis \cite{dupinSystematicXPSStudies2000,bebenseeAdsorptionOxygenWater2008,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}. Nonetheless, two trends can be discerned: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item unlike the preceding alkaline earth metal, magnesium \cite{dobrovolskyXPSStudyInfluence2017}, recent data indicate that BE(Ca 2s in \ce{Ca^0}) $>$ BE(Ca 2s in CaO) $\approx$ BE(Ca 2s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) \cite{ochsCO2ChemisorptionCa1998,cristHandbookMonochromaticXPS2000a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}, and 
	\item BE(Bulk O 1s in CaO) $\approx$ BE(bulk O 1s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) $<$ BE(hydroxyls O 1s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) \cite{dupinSystematicXPSStudies2000,bebenseeAdsorptionOxygenWater2008,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}.
\end{inparaenum}
Only the \cpx{E_\infty} protocol satisfies these two criteria, and provide the correct trends. Consequently, a consistent treatment of both gas-phase systems and slabs using the same method appears not to be feasible in this work. Also note that our protocol globally underestimates the \dbe{} for O 1s (which is, \textit{e.g.}, smaller than \SI{-7}{\electronvolt} for bulk CaO\cite{cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}). Finally, Bagus \emph{et al.}\cite{bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019} also argued recently that the difference between bulk and surface O 1s in CaO, which amounts to \SI{0.4}{\electronvolt} with this protocol, is overestimated  and should be $<\SI{0.1}{\electronvolt}$.

\subsection{Adsorption on slab: geometrical and energetic aspects}\label{sec:geom}

The optimized geometries of compounds \textbf{a}-\textbf{j}, following their adsorption on each side of the slabs, are depicted in Figs.~\ref{fig:distsad}-\ref{fig:distsj}. The interaction energy per molecule, calculated as $\Delta E_{int} = \frac{1}{2}\,(E_{2X@Y} - E_Y - 2E_X)$, where $E_X$ represents the energy of a single adsorbate, optimized in gas phase, and $E_Y$ is the energy of the neat substrate, is presented in Table~\ref{tab:int}. Note that no thermochemical corrections (i.e., zero-point vibrational energy and thermal corrections) have been applied in these calculations.

There are three primary modes of interaction between the substrate and the adsorbate: \begin{inparaenum}[i)] \item van der Waals (vdW) forces, 
\item hydrogen bonding (HB), and 
\item chemisorption.\cite{calatayudExploringMetalOxides2011} 
\end{inparaenum}
First, hydrocarbons (\textbf{a}–\textbf{d}) mainly interact through vdW forces, as indicated by the relatively large distances between the adsorbate and substrate (Fig.~\ref{fig:distsad}) and the low interaction energies ($\Delta E_{int} > \SI{-1}{\electronvolt}$). However, for unsaturated hydrocarbons (\textbf{c}-\textbf{d}), the distances are shorter ($\sim\SI{3}{\angstrom}$) compared to saturated ones (\textbf{a}-\textbf{b}) on the \ce{Ca^0} and \ce{CaH2} slabs, leading to slightly higher interaction energies.

Second, HB interactions are significant between \ce{CaO.H2O} and oxygen-containing mole\-cules (\textbf{e}-\textbf{j}) from the structural viewpoint. For non-protic molecules (\textbf{e} to \textbf{h}), interaction energies decrease (\textit{i.e.}, the binding is stronger) as the oxygen(substrate)--hydrogen(slab) distance decreases (up to $\Delta E_{int}<-\SI{0.7}{\electronvolt}$ for \textbf{h}), with the molecule's oxygen acting as the HB donor. For protic molecules (\textbf{i} and \textbf{j}), additional HB interactions form between the substrate hydrogen and slab oxygens. The multiplication of slab-substrate HB interactions correlates with a further increase of the interaction energies (in absolute value).


Oxygen-containing molecules can exhibit significant interaction energies ($\Delta E_{int} < \SI{-1.5}{\electronvolt}$) with the \ce{Ca^0} and \ce{CaH2} slabs, primarily driven by strong oxygen--calcium interactions. These are often accompanied by small interatomic distances, indicative of chemisorption. This effect is particularly pronounced for PTMEG (\textbf{j}), where multiple interactions account for the large interaction energy. Similarly, \ce{CO2} (\textbf{e}) and \ce{CH2=O} (\textbf{f}) display notable interactions with the Ca and \ce{CaH2} slab. Note that for \ce{CO2} on \ce{CaH2}, two binding configurations are possible (Fig.~\ref{fig:distsei}). These cases are distinguishable by their difference of hybridization (\textit{e.g.}, from \ce{sp^2} to \ce{sp^3} for \textbf{f}). These transformations are facilitated by interactions with a slab’s calcium (Ca slab) or hydrogen (\ce{CaH2 slab)} atoms.

Interestingly, the \ce{CaO} slab exhibits a distinct trend. Interactions with non-protic molecules (\textbf{a}-\textbf{h}) yield low interaction energies, comparable to van der Waals forces, though larger than HB (which are, typically, of the order of \SI{0.15}{\electronvolt} \cite{boeseDensityFunctionalTheory2015}). For protic molecules (\textbf{i}-\textbf{j}), while HB accounts for some of the slab-substrate interactions, the small hydrogen(substrate)--oxygen(slab) distances observed suggest the occurrence of proton transfer between the substrate and the slab, resulting in a large interaction energy (in absolute value) for \textbf{j}.

These observations provide insights into potential degradation mechanisms involving these molecules. The proton transfers to the CaO surface support the hypothesis of hydroxyl formation on the slab. Moreover, reactions involving hydrogen from the \ce{CaH2} slab indicate possible surface reactivity under certain conditions.  It should be noted that these reactions are not necessarily associated with an important modification of the slab structure, as measured by the mean displacements of the calcium atoms after adsorption (Table S5). In fact, \ce{CaH2} tends to be the most affected by adsorption, regardless of the adsorbate.

Directly comparing binding energies (BE's) of molecules in the gas phase with those adsorbed on a slab is methodologically problematic (as discussed \textit{vide supra}). Therefore, the focus here will be on the binding energies before (slab) and after (slab + adsorbate) adsorption.
The spectra corresponding to the adsorption of compound \textbf{a} (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadsac}a) is first analyzed. Adsorption induces a slight shift in the bulk BE's (labeled ``b"), which ideally should remain unaffected. While using thicker slabs could mitigate this issue, the discussion  focuses on the surface BE's (labeled ``s"), which exhibit the most significant adsorption-induced changes. In this example, the surface calcium and oxygen atoms closest to \textbf{a} (labeled ``s$^\star$") show similar BE values before and after adsorption, consistent with weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions and large substrate-adsorbate distances. Additionally, a peak corresponding to the carbon of \textbf{a} is observed around $\dbe = \SI{0}{\electronvolt}$, characteristic of a saturated carbon. The spectra for compound \textbf{b} (Fig.~S7a) are quite similar, though the carbon peak is larger due to the slightly different BE's of \ce{-CH3} and \ce{-CH_2-} groups, with the latter showing a higher BE.


Next, the spectra of compound \textbf{c} (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadsac}b) is analyzed. In this case, the surface calcium atoms in close contact with the adsorbate (labeled ``s$^\star$") experience a shift towards lower BE's (sometimes accompanied by other surface atoms,  labeled ``s''). No significant changes are observed in the oxygen atoms, whose BE values remain consistent with the previous spectra. In comparison to \textbf{a}, a distinct peak corresponding to the unsaturated carbon atoms appears around $\dbe = \SI{-1}{\electronvolt}$. This peak also shows that the distance between the adsorbate and the surface can have an impact (except for CaO, the larger the distance, the smaller \dbe{}), as reported by Taucher \emph{et al.}\cite{taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}. The spectra for compound \textbf{d} (Fig.~S7b) show a similar trend, with a separate peak for each type of carbon.

\XPSsab{11a}{11b}{a}{c}

\clearpage

Turning to compound \textbf{e} (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadse}), several notable features arise, as reactions occur between \ce{CO2} and the \ce{Ca^0} and \ce{CaH2} slabs. In the latter, these interactions affect the oxygen spectra, resulting in two distinct peaks, as there are two distinct cases (Fig.~\ref{fig:distsei}): one associated with one of the oxygens of a quasi-$D_{\infty h}$ \ce{CO2} molecule  (around $\dbe = \SI{1}{\electronvolt}$, labeled ``linear''), and another associated with a bent $C_{2v}$-like \ce{CO2} molecule (around $\dbe = \SI{-2}{\electronvolt}$, labeled ``bent''), which arises from the reaction. Their position is again correlated with the distance between the slab and the adsorbate. For instance, the peak associated with linear \ce{CO2} shifts to lower binding energy (BE) values on CaO compared to \ce{CaH2}, indicating a stronger interaction in the latter case. The relative intensities of these peaks depend on the composition and coverage of the slab, which were not investigated in this study.\cite{dahleSituPreparationCalcium2012,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a} The other O 1s spectra present one or the other peak, depending on the slab-substrate interaction. The same goes for the C 1s spectra, the C atom of the linear and bent \ce{CO2} molecules gives rise to peaks located around $\dbe = \SI{3.5}{\electronvolt}$ and $\dbe = \SI{1.5}{\electronvolt}$, respectively, but with some variability for this last peak: interaction between \ce{CO2} and an hydrogen of \ce{CaH2} leads to a larger BE (at \SI{1.9}{\electronvolt}) than interaction with Ca in \ce{Ca^0} (at \SI{0.9}{\electronvolt}). Finally, the surface calcium atoms are also affected, which results in changes in Ca 2s spectra, particularly with \ce{CaH2}. Surprisingly, it does not affect much the spectrum for \ce{Ca^0}.

The results of O 1s are in line with previous studies by Maus-Friedrichs and colleagues\cite{ochsCO2ChemisorptionCa1998,voigtsAdsorptionCO2CO2009,dahleSituPreparationCalcium2012}, who investigated the adsorption of \ce{CO2} on \ce{Ca^0} and \ce{CaO}, showing the formation of a calcite layer. Their most recent experimental XPS data\cite{dahleSituPreparationCalcium2012} indicate that BE(O 1s in \ce{CO3^-}) is higher than BE(bulk O 1s in CaO) by approximately \SI{3}{\electronvolt}, a trend similar to that observed in this study, although the present case concerns \ce{CO2}. 

The spectra for compounds \textbf{f} and \textbf{g} (Fig.~S8) exhibit similar trends. However, the carbon in compound \textbf{f} undergoes a transition from a planar $C_{2v}$-like geometry to a triangular pyramid (resembling a $C_{3v}$ symmetry, though there is one C-O bond and two C-H bonds) upon reacting with \ce{CaH2}, and thus the peaks appear at lower \dbe{}. Additionally, the strong interaction between the oxygen atoms in compounds \textbf{f} and \textbf{g} and the \ce{Ca^0} substrate results in a notable shift towards lower \dbe{} values in both the O 1s and C 1s spectra.  A notable shift in the Ca 2s results for \ce{CaO.H2O} slab is also noted, associated with the thickness of the slab.

\XPSsa{12}{e}

Finally, the spectra of THF and its short model polymer (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadshj}) are analyzed together. The main observations are: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item the peaks associated to the ether moiety in both molecules presents large BE's (around \SI{0}{\electronvolt} in O 1s, where it is labeled ``\ce{O-C}", and around \SI{1.6}{\electronvolt} for C 1s, labeled ``\ce{C-O}"), 
	\item for compound \textbf{j}, a second peak with lower BE is attributed to the presence of alcohol moieties (around \SI{-0.5}{\electronvolt} in O 1s, where it is labeled ``\ce{OH-C}", and around \SI{1.5}{\electronvolt} for C 1s, labeled ``\ce{C-OH}"), 
	\item cyclization slightly affects the peak associated with saturated carbons (labeled ``\ce{C-C}") towards larger values, and
	\item when grafted on CaO, proton transfer between PTMEG (\textbf{j}) and the surface leads to a shift of about \SI{-2}{\electronvolt}  (thus similar to the value for compounds \textbf{f}) in the O 1s spectrum and of about \SI{0.7}{\electronvolt} in C 1s (again, becoming similar to compound \textbf{f}). This is also the case for compound \textbf{i} (Fig.~S9).
\end{inparaenum}

The trends across all spectra are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:trends}. Given the low sensitivity of the Ca 2s core level to environmental changes, it has been excluded from the analysis. The binding energy (BE) values for C 1s and O 1s exhibit a clear correlation with the hybridization state of the atoms and the electronegativity of their neighboring atoms, as anticipated.\cite{stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020} 
Key findings of this study are also summarized in this last figure, which include: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item the pronounced effect of oxygen-calcium interactions on the BE, highlighted by the red bars for C 1s values and also evident in the distinction between ``OH-C'' and ``OH-Ca,'' 
	\item the hybridization changes resulting from chemisorption between the slab and the adsorbate, and 
	\item for \ce{CO2}, the observation that such a change of hybridization produces BE values (``C=O$\cdots$Ca") akin to those of \ce{CaCO3}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this study, the adsorption of a model system, THF, and of its potential degradation products on various calcium surfaces was investigated using periodic boundary condition DFT calculations. Slabs of calcium (\ce{Ca^0}), its oxide (\ce{CaO}), and its hydride (\ce{CaH2}) were constructed, with full hydroxide coverage also considered for \ce{CaO}. Geometry optimizations were performed for both the bare slabs and the adsorbate-slab complexes. The interactions range from van der Waals forces to chemisorption. Two key reaction types were identified: reactions between the adsorbate’s carbon atoms and the surface (notably with \ce{CO2}), and proton transfers between the alcohol moiety of the adsorbate and the \ce{CaO} surface. The first reaction is known to lead to the formation of calcite\cite{dahleSituPreparationCalcium2012}, while the second indicates a possible mechanism for the formation of hydroxyls. These results provide valuable insight into the first steps of SEI formation.

Since XPS provides valuable insights  to experimentalists on the chemical environment of atoms and the transformations they undergo during adsorption, the simulation of these spectra was performed. However, careful attention must be paid to the methodologies employed, as direct comparisons between results can be problematic due to potential inconsistencies across different systems. To address these issues, a thorough assessment of the methodological approaches was first conducted. This evaluation indicates that while the \cpx[n]{0} and \cpx[n]{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}} protocols are highly reliable for gas-phase molecules, the \cpx{E_\infty} protocol more accurately reproduces experimental trends for calcium slabs and their derivatives.

After validating the methodology, it was applied to the various adsorbate-substrate systems. The reactions between the adsorbate and the surface lead,  in certain cases, to significant changes in the O 1s and C 1s spectra, while the Ca 2s binding energies appeared less affected. Notably, the interactions between oxygen and Ca are also clearly observable in the spectra. Our results are in agreement with experimental studies on the adsorption of \ce{CO2} on calcium surfaces, and close to the one of \ce{CaCO3}.\cite{voigtsAdsorptionCO2CO2009}

Taken together, these findings establish trends for analyzing XPS spectra in the context of SEI formation. Future studies will now explore the impact of incorporating boron derivatives or other counterions to coordinate \ce{Ca^2+}. For example, fluorinated byproducts should be important if  \ce{BF4-}, an interesting candidate,\cite{bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023} is considered as a component of the electrolyte. However, conducting such research requires a detailed mechanistic understanding of the degradation reactions involving these species,\cite{youngPreventingElectrolyteDecomposition2021,yamijalaStabilityCalciumIon2021,baonguyenInvestigatingAbnormalConductivity2022,nguyenSolvationReductionCoupling2023} and we are currently working on these topics.

\added{More broadly, this study demonstrates that the prediction of spectroscopic data, particularly XPS binding energies, through theoretical chemistry methods can yield valuable insights for experimental investigations, especially by highlighting the roles of specific atoms and the reactions they undergo.} \cite{ebadiInsightsLiMetalOrganic2019}\added{ Furthermore, such simulations enable the exploration of reactive intermediates, as illustrated in this work. Finally, they facilitate the disentanglement of surface and bulk contributions, a task that remains experimentally challenging.}
