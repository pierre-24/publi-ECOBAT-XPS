\title{Prediction of XPS binding energies for molecules grafted on calcium surfaces}

\def\dbe{\ensuremath{\Delta\text{BE}}}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This study investigates the adsorption of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and its potential degradation products on various calcium surfaces using quantum chemistry calculations. Slabs of metallic calcium (\ce{Ca^0}), calcium oxide (\ce{CaO}), and calcium hydride (\ce{CaH2}) were modeled, with additional consideration given to full hydroxide coverage on \ce{CaO}. Two primary reaction types were identified: reactions between the carbon atoms of the adsorbates and the surface, particularly with \ce{CO2}, and proton transfer from the alcohol moiety in the adsorbates to the \ce{CaO} surface.
	
	To complement the structural insights, simulated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were analyzed to provide detailed information on the chemical environments of atoms during adsorption. After a careful methodological evaluation, it was applied to the different systems, showing significant changes in O 1s and C 1s spectra after adsorption, while Ca 2s binding energies remained less affected. Interactions between oxygen and metallic calcium (\ce{Ca^0}) were also clearly observed in the spectra. Our results aligns with experimental data, when available.	These findings provide valuable trends for analyzing XPS spectra in the context of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation.

\section{Introduction}

Batteries represent a crucial technology for the transition to a climate-neutral society. Since their market introduction, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have evolved into a highly mature technology, currently utilized in a wide range of applications.\cite{zubiLithiumionBatteryState2018,kimLithiumionBatteriesOutlook2019} Despite their established performance, LIBs face significant limitations that hinder their suitability for large-scale applications, primarily due to different fundamental issues, one of them being the insufficient energy density.\cite{luReviewKeyIssues2013,li30YearsLithiumIon2018} Addressing this point can be achieved through the use of divalent cations, such as \ce{Ca^2+}.\cite{arroyo-dedompabloAchievementsChallengesProspects2020,taghavi-kahaghPoweringFutureComprehensive2024} However, its elevated reactivity demands the design of specialized electrolytes to support a reversible mechanism. Additionally, detailed insight into the chemistry of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) remains crucial.\cite{melemedImpactDifferentialCa22023,zhaoRevealingSolidElectrolyte2022}
In the literature, calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) utilize electrolytes such as dimethyl ether (DME), ethylene carbonate (EC), glyme, or tetrahydrofuran (THF), often in combination with weakly coordinating anions like \ce{BH4-} or \ce{BF4-} \cite{songElectrolyteOptimizationInterphase2022,zhaoRevealingSolidElectrolyte2022,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023}. 
Both experimental \cite{songElectrolyteOptimizationInterphase2022,melemedImpactDifferentialCa22023,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023} and quantum chemistry studies \cite{hahnCriticalRoleConfigurational2020,liepinyaComputationalComparisonEther2021,yamijalaStabilityCalciumIon2021} have explored SEI formation, typically focusing on the degradation pathways arising from the interactions between calcium, the electrolyte, and coordinating anions\cite{wuUnderstandingSolidElectrolyte2021,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023}. While these studies provide valuable insights, the comparison between experimental spectroscopic data and simulated spectra is an important aspect that can significantly enhance the understanding, both at the experimental and theoretical level, but is not always performed.


X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive, quantitative spectroscopy that allows for the identification of elements within the material or at its surface. It belongs to the family of photoemission spectroscopies, where the energy of electrons emitted by the photoelectric effect is analyzed. Specifically, XPS uses a beam of soft X-rays ($\SI{100}{\electronvolt} < h\nu < \SI{10}{\kilo\electronvolt}$), enabling the probing of core electrons (low principal quantum number) \cite{stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020}. The conservation of energy is described by the equation:
\begin{equation}
	h\nu = \text{BE} + E_{\text{kin}} + \phi, \label{eq:xps}
\end{equation}
where BE is the binding energy of the electron, $E_{\text{kin}}$ is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron (measured by the detector), and $\phi$ is the work function, which accounts for surface effects and detector contributions. Using a source of monochromatic X-rays (such as Al $K_\alpha$, $h\nu = \SI{1486.7}{\electronvolt}$), it is possible to determine BE from $E_{\text{kin}}$ \cite{stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020}. The binding energy depends on how tightly the electron is bound in its orbital, making it sensitive to the oxidation state and chemical environment of the originating atom. It is routinely used experimentally to gain understanding on the SEI composition of both LIBs and CIBs \cite{forero-saboyaUnderstandingNaturePassivation2020a,songElectrolyteOptimizationInterphase2022,bodinBoronBasedFunctionalAdditives2023,melemedImpactDifferentialCa22023,linDecipheringDynamicInterfacial2024}. However, to the best of our knowledge, while there have been some theoretical studies for the SEI of LIBs via the simulation of the XPS spectra\cite{ebadiInsightsLiMetalOrganic2019}, none exists for CIBs.

Therefore, this study explores the XPS spectra related to the degradation and polymerization of THF, using it as a model system. Several potential degradation products (Fig.~\ref{fig:THFdegradation}), along with the polymerization into poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (PTMEG), are investigated on various calcium substrates, including calcium oxide and calcium hydride. These molecules are chosen in order to consider different relevant chemical moieties. Following a review of the theoretical methods and the computational details, the results are presented. First, the different protocols for calculating binding energies are evaluated, and then discusses the geometries and energies. Finally, the core of the paper is the analysis of the simulated XPS spectra.

\section{Theoretical methods}\label{sec:theo}

From a quantum chemistry perspective, binding energy is akin to the ionization energy of core electrons:
\begin{equation}
	\text{BE}_i = E^{N-1}_i(\text{final}) - E^{N}(\text{initial}), \label{eq:dscf}
\end{equation}
where $E^{N}$ and $E^{N-1}_i$ are the energies of the initial $N$-electron non-ionized state and the final $N-1$ electron ionized state with a core hole on atom $i$. While these energies could be obtained through (relativistic) multi-configuration approaches, this is impractical for large systems. Even CIS or TD-DFT based calculations of excitation energies are challenging, as they correspond to highly excited states \cite{vinesPredictionCoreLevel2018}.

For gas-phase molecules, classical quantum chemistry tools can be utilized. At the HF level, core-level BE can be approximated using Koopmans' theorem, which correlates BEs to the orbital energy of the removed electron. This is known as the initial state (IS) or frozen orbitals (FO) approach.\cite{pueyobellafontPredictionCoreLevel2015} However, electronic relaxation effects are neglected. More accurate values can be obtained using Eq.~\eqref{eq:dscf}, by computing the energy difference between initial and final states at the HF level, known as the $\Delta$SCF approach, which includes final state (FS) effects. While this method may provide quantitative agreement in some cases, electron correlation effects are significant, necessitating the use of density functional theory (DFT), for which Koopmans' theorem no longer applies \cite{pueyobellafontPredictionCoreLevel2015,pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017,kleinNutsBoltsCorehole2021}.

Treating solids or surfaces adds further complexity.\cite{garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012,bagusXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2024} Generally, only valence levels are explicitly treated, with pseudopotentials (PPs) modeling core electrons. The projected augmented wave (PAW) method maps results to all-electron wavefunctions using specially designed PPs and transformations\cite{blochlProjectorAugmentedwaveMethod1994}. A core hole can be generated, neglecting the relaxation of other core electrons but including valence electron relaxation\cite{garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012}. This limits the accuracy of absolute BE descriptions.
A complementary challenge arises due to the use of periodic boundary conditions (PBC), since the core hole is periodically repeated, creating an infinitely charged system. Two approaches can address this: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item add the excited electron to the bottom of the conduction band (CBM or LUMO for isolated molecules), or 
	\item remove the excited electron from the system and use a background counter-charge.
\end{inparaenum}
The first approach underestimates BEs, resembling absorption processes, while the second induces physically incorrect effects, further complicating absolute BE prediction.\cite{olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006,garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012,pueyobellafontPerformanceTPSSFunctional2016,pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017,taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}

However, relative BE can be estimated by computing wavefunctions for a fractional number of electrons using Slater transition state theory and Janak's theorem \cite{janakProofThatFrac1978}, resulting in the Slater-Janak (SJ) approach \cite{hiraoImprovedSlaterTransition2021}. In this work, BE are computed with a half-electron removed from orbital $i$ and placed either in the conduction band or in the vacuum, referred to as the SJ and SJ\textsuperscript{n} approaches\cite{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017}, respectively (Fig.~\ref{fig:method}). The advantages and limitations of these methods remain a topic of ongoing debate in the literature\cite{olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006,taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}. Nevertheless, they have been widely applied, particularly the SJ approach, in the study of surfaces\cite{olovssonFirstPrincipleCalculations2010,bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019,bagusXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2024} and adsorbates on surfaces\cite{babyAnchoringBendingPentacene2015,salvarezzaExploringCoreLevel2015,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}.

After the calculation, the corresponding eigenvalue, $\varepsilon_i\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, is extracted. The binding energy is then calculated as:
\begin{equation}
	\text{BE}_i = 
	E_{ref}- \varepsilon_i\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right), \label{eq:xpsbe}
\end{equation}
where $E_{ref}$ is a reference energy, chosen to ensure consistency across systems. Different choices exists in the literature, and thus this study considers several choices for $E_{ref}$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $E_{ref}=0$, thus using only the orbital energy,
	\item $E_{ref}=E_F$, where the Fermi energy $E_F$ is used, computed with \texttt{EFERMI = MIDGAP} in the VASP input to account for Gaussian smearing,
	\item $E_{ref}=E_\infty$, the vacuum energy, calculated by taking the electrostatic potential in the vacuum region of the cell (when dipole correction are included, the vacuum potential is not equal in both side of the slab, the average value is considered),
	\item $E_{ref}=\phi$, where the work function of the system $\phi = E_\infty - E_F$ is considered\cite{kahnFermiLevelWork2015}, and
	\item $E_{ref}= \varepsilon_{ref}$, where $\varepsilon_{ref}$ is the orbital energy of another atom in the cell. Although it might seem reasonable to use calcium, which is present in all slabs, this approach would depend on the slab's nature and would be not possible for gas-phase molecules. To overcome this, an Argon atom (to mimic calcium) is placed in the vacuum region, and $\varepsilon_{ref}=\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, computing a binding energy for a given atom requires to select a computational protocol, which includes the choice of a  way to deal with the electron reorganization  (in this work, SJ or SJ\textsuperscript{n}), and a $E_{ref}$.
It should be noted, however, that extracting $E_\infty$ is not feasible for bulk systems, where no vacuum region exists, or for charged systems, where the electrostatic potential is not constant in the vacuum region. This latter condition occurs when employing the SJ\textsuperscript{n} method. It is however possible to correct the Fermi level energy to remove the impact of the background of charge, as discussed in Ref.~\citenum{lozovoiInitioSimulationCharged2001}. This possibility is referred to as $E_{ref}=E_F'$, where $E_F' = E_F - \max\{E_{elst}(z)\}$, with $E_{elst}(z)$ being the planar average of the electrostatic potential along the $z$ axis.

Finally, while the determination of absolute binding energies (BE) is challenging from a theoretical perspective, the measurement or calculation of the work function, $\phi$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:xps}, is also complex. As a result, both experimentalists and quantum chemists often focus on the relative binding energy, $\Delta\text{BE}$, which is the difference in binding energy for a given atom with respect to a reference compound \cite{vinesPredictionCoreLevel2018,stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020,greczynskiXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2020}. In this contribution, relative BE values are computed as:\begin{equation}
	\Delta\text{BE}_i = \text{BE}_i - \text{BE}(\text{ref}), \label{eq:dbe}
\end{equation} 
using the calculated or experimental BE values for \ce{CH4}, \ce{NH3}, \ce{H2O}, \ce{B2H6}, and \ce{HF} as references for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, boron, and fluorine, respectively. The experimental values are taken from Ref.~\citenum{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017}. For calcium, the value for bulk Ca in CaO is used, taken from the XPS library \cite{cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a} (computationally, a  2x2 slab containing 16 layers is used).

	
\section{Computational details}\label{sec:comp}

All calculations (optimization and binding energies) were performed using the PBE-D3 level of theory with VASP (version 6.4.1) and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method \cite{blochlProjectorAugmentedwaveMethod1994}. The energy convergence criterion was set to \SI{e-4}{\electronvolt}, with a cutoff of \SI{550}{\electronvolt} for the kinetic energy of the plane waves. Gaussian smearing of the energy of valence electrons, with a width of \SI{0.2}{\electronvolt}, was applied. Brillouin zone integration was performed at the $\Gamma$-point for molecules in the gas phase, using a 4x4x4 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh\cite{monkhorstSpecialPointsBrillouinzone1976} for bulk calculations, and a 4x4x1 mesh for slab calculations. The \texttt{Ca\_sv} pseudopotential\cite{blochlProjectorAugmentedwaveMethod1994,kresseUltrasoftPseudopotentialsProjector1999} was employed to model calcium.

\paragraph{Geometry optimization.} All optimizations were carried out using the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno  (L-BFGS) algorithm, driven by the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package \cite{larsenAtomicSimulationEnvironment2017}, using VASP energies and forces as inputs, until the force on all atoms was below \SI{e-2}{\electronvolt\per\angstrom}.

In gas phase, each molecule was placed in a cubic box with a side length of \SI{20}{\angstrom} (with the molecule center of mass placed at the origin) and optumized (with frozen cell parameters).

In order to build slabs, bulk \ce{Ca^0} (from the Material Project, \texttt{MP-45}), CaO (\texttt{MP-2605}), and \ce{CaH2} (\texttt{MP-23713}) were selected, and their atomic positions and cell parameters were optimized. Subsequently, to determine the optimal surface orientation, 1x1 slabs with increasing thickness along different low-index orientations [(100), (110), and (111)] were constructed using ASE \cite{larsenAtomicSimulationEnvironment2017}. The slabs were relaxed with the central two layers frozen to mimic bulk conditions, with the distance between slab repetitions set to 10 times the $c$ cell parameter of the bulk. For each orientation, the surface energy $\gamma^{hkl}$ was calculated by least-squares fitting of the following expression \cite{sunEfficientCreationConvergence2013,tranSurfaceEnergiesElemental2016}:
\begin{equation}
	E^{hkl}(N) = E_0\,N + 2A\,\gamma^{hkl} \label{eq:surf}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of layers in the slab, $A$ is the slab surface area, $E^{hkl}(N)$ is the energy of the relaxed slab cut along $(hkl)$, and $E_0$ approximates the energy of one layer. The results (Table \ref{tab:surf}, Fig.~S2) indicate that (100) surfaces are the most energetically favorable, consistent with the literature \cite{deleeuwDensityFunctionalTheory2000,ebadiInsightsLiMetalOrganic2019}. 
Thus, using these (100) orientation, 3x3 (\ce{Ca^0} and CaO) and 2x2 (\ce{CaH2}) slabs (ensuring a slab surface of $\sim 10\times \SI{10}{\angstrom}$) consisting of 6 layers, with a vacuum of \SI{20}{\angstrom} between two slab repetitions were created and relaxed (with frozen cell parameters). 

Additionally, given that it reported to be favorable\cite{deleeuwDensityFunctionalTheory2000,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a}, the adsorption of water on the CaO surface was investigated. In fact, the contamination of CaO by surface hydroxyls was reported in many experiments\cite{dupinSystematicXPSStudies2000,bebenseeAdsorptionOxygenWater2008,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}. Thus, an additional slab with full coverage (1 water molecule per surface Ca), denoted as \ce{CaO.H_2O}, was built and its geometry was also optimized.

	\label{tab:surf}
\end{table}

Finally, compounds \textbf{a}--\textbf{j} (Fig.~\ref{fig:THFdegradation}) were positioned on both sides of the slabs, initially placed approximately \SI{6}{\angstrom} from the surface. A final optimization was then performed, keeping the cell parameters and the two central layers fixed.

\paragraph{Binding energies.}  VASP allows targeting a specific orbital, $i$, by removing half an electron from it. For SJ calculation, dipole corrections (using the \texttt{IDIPOL} keyword) are included. For SJ\textsuperscript{n} calculations, it is necessary to adjust the total number of valence electrons (by default, half an electron is added; see Fig.~\ref{fig:method}) using the \texttt{NELECT} keyword. However, it is not possible to account for spin-orbit coupling in such calculations, and therefore we limit ourselves to the study of 1s and 2s binding energies. To simulate a spectrum, a Gaussian function centered at each computed \dbe{} is used. Unless otherwise specified, a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt} is employed.

To evaluate the accuracy of the different computational protocols (SJ and SJ\textsuperscript{n} methods, as well as the choice of $E_{ref}$), two sets of calculations were conducted. First, the results from Pueyo Bellafont \textit{et al.} \cite{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017}, which compare experimental and theoretical gas-phase \dbe{} values (computed at the same level of approximation as this study), were replicated. Their dataset includes 184 experimental absolute binding energies (BEs) from 68 molecules, covering carbon ($N=107$), nitrogen ($N=20$), oxygen ($N=22$), boron ($N=20$), and fluorine ($N=15$) atoms (Fig.~S1). Each molecule was placed in a cubic box with a side length of \SI{20}{\angstrom}, centered at the molecule's center of mass. The \dbe{} values were then computed for each atom of interest. Other parameters, such as vacuum energy, were extracted from the density (\texttt{CHGCAR}) and potential (\texttt{LOCPOT}) files. For calculations involving an additional argon atom, it was positioned at the center of the box.

In parallel, the effect of slab thickness was examined using the bare slabs of increasing thickness described above. Binding energies were calculated on 2x2 slabs with a (100) orientation, separated by an interslab distance of \SI{20}{\angstrom}. The geometries were based on the optimized 1x1 slabs from the surface energy study, with a supercell created and then adjusting the interslab spacing. The \dbe{} values were computed for each atom of interest, and the relevant parameters were extracted accordingly. For calculations involving an additional argon atom, placed in a cell where the slab is positioned at the center, the argon atom was located at the origin.

Finally, the \dbe{} values were calculated for each atom of interest in the molecules grafted onto the various surfaces, using the selected reference energy. It is important to note that, in these calculations with the SJ protocol, the relatively small surface area of the slabs may introduce artifacts due to the periodic repetition of core holes in close proximity, especially for adsorbates that are far from the surface\cite{taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}. Although larger supercells could be employed to mitigate this issue, doing so would significantly increase computational time.

\subsection{Selection of a computational protocol for binding energies}\label{sec:proto}

A comparison between experimental and computed \dbe{} values for carbon is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:xps_C185_C}. Consistent with previous studies \cite{pueyobellafontPredictingCoreLevel2017,golzeAccurateAbsoluteRelative2020}, the \cp[n]{0} protocol provides reliable results for all atoms, exhibiting a very small mean error and an acceptable standard deviation. However, achieving this level of agreement requires using a reference per atom (Table S1), as the discrepancy between experimental and computed absolute BEs tends to increase with the atomic number. Similarly, using \cp[n]{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}} results in small errors, which is consistent with the observation of Garci√†-Gil \textit{et al.}\cite{garcia-gilCalculationCoreLevel2012} (although they only used IS calculations). Across the entire set of 184 \dbe{} values, the combination of each reference energy with the SJ\textsuperscript{n} approach yields comparable results (Fig.~\ref{fig:xps_C185}). 

In contrast, other reference energies significantly degrade the accuracy of the predicted gas-phase \dbe{}. The largest errors are observed when using the Fermi energy, \cp{E_F}, \cp[n]{E_F}, or \cp [n]{E_F'}. In combination with the SJ\textsuperscript{n} protocol it leads to underestimated \dbe{} values. Then, \cp{0}, \cp{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}}, and \cp{E_\infty} perform similarly, and finally, the lowest error found when using \cp{\phi}, although it remains substantial. Moreover, all reference energies combined with the SJ protocol tend to overestimate the \dbe{} values. One possible reason is that placing a (half) electron in the LUMO of a molecule significantly alters its electronic structure (see Fig.~S10),~ often more so than the effect of the core-hole itself, which appears to be better captured by the SJ\textsuperscript{n} approach.\cite{taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}

The situation differs for slabs. The impact of slab thickness ($N$) on the Ca 2s binding energy, evaluated using both protocols, is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:slabsthicknessSJ}--\ref{fig:slabsthicknessSJn}. The results reveal a substantial difference (exceeding \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt} for certain reference energies) between the surface layers (defined as the first and last layers of the slab) and the bulk \dbe{}, with relatively small standard deviation (values are provided in Tables S4-S5). With all protocols, BE(surface Ca 2s) $>$ BE(bulk Ca 2s). The difference between bulk and surface BEs are referred to as surface core level shifts (SCLS),\cite{olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006,bagusChemicalSignificanceXray2023} which as been reported for metals\cite{aldenInitioSurfaceCorelevel1993,weinertCorelevelShiftsBulk1995,olovssonCorelevelShiftsComplex2006} and oxides\cite{harmerSpeciesFormedCuprite2009,lousadaFirstStagesOxide2018,bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019}. One of the main cause of this difference is the change in Madelung energy between bulk and surface atoms\cite{nelinSurfaceCorelevelBinding2014}, thought this is not the only effect\cite{bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019,bagusChemicalSignificanceXray2023,bagusXrayPhotoelectronSpectroscopy2024}.

Another key observation is that slab thickness influences some results more than others. For calculations with \cp{E_F}, \cp{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}}, and \cp{E_\infty}, the predicted values remain nearly constant as $N$ increases. Conversely, the SJ\textsuperscript{n} method appears very sensitive to the system size. It should however be noted that with $E_{ref}=\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}$, calculation fails to converge or provide slightly different values, resulting in large standard deviations, notably for CaO with $N=16$ layers. 

For O 1s, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:slabOH2}, where simulated XPS spectra for CaO and \ce{CaO.H2O} (both with 6 layers) are shown, the distinction between bulk and surface contributions is notable. In the case of CaO, BE(bulk O 1s in CaO) $\geq$ BE(surface O 1s in CaO), whereas in \ce{CaO.H2O}, the reverse trend is observed, consistent across all protocols. Furthermore, BE(bulk O 1s in CaO) $\approx$ BE(bulk O 1s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) when using \cp{E_F}, \cp{E_\infty}, or \cp{\varepsilon_{Ar,2s}}. However, the latter yields unreliable results, as evidenced by the spurious peak at \dbe{} = \SI{0}{\electronvolt} in the O 1s spectra, suggesting an artificial differentiation between hydroxyl environments that is not reflected when using other reference energies. Finally, for the hydroxylated slabs, BE(surface O 1s) $\geq$ BE(hydroxyl O 1s). This latter results was also found by Fujimori \emph{et al.} \cite{fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a} via calculations using a similar method to ours, which also showed than the separation between these two BEs depends on the hydroxyl coverage of the surface.

Experimentally, XPS spectra for calcium metal slabs and their oxides, including Ca 2s binding energies, are scarce. Some values from various sources are summarized in Table S3. To the best of our knowledge, no reported measurements exist for \ce{CaH2}, and data for other peaks are limited \cite{franzenXPSSpectraCrystalline1977,sveinbjornssonIonicConductivityFormation2014}. Moreover, due to calcium's high reactivity, contamination by oxides, hydroxyls, and hydrocarbons complicates the analysis \cite{dupinSystematicXPSStudies2000,bebenseeAdsorptionOxygenWater2008,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}. Nonetheless, two trends can be discerned: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item unlike the preceding alkaline earth metal, magnesium \cite{dobrovolskyXPSStudyInfluence2017}, recent data suggest that BE(Ca 2s in \ce{Ca^0}) $>$ BE(Ca 2s in CaO) $\approx$ BE(Ca 2s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) \cite{ochsCO2ChemisorptionCa1998,cristHandbookMonochromaticXPS2000a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}, and 
	\item BE(Bulk O 1s in CaO) $\approx$ BE(bulk O 1s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) $<$ BE(hydroxyls O 1s in \ce{CaO.H2O}) \cite{dupinSystematicXPSStudies2000,bebenseeAdsorptionOxygenWater2008,fujimoriInteractionWaterCaO2016a,cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}.
\end{inparaenum}

Only the \cp{E_\infty} protocol satisfies these two criteria, and provide the correct trends. Consequently, a consistent treatment of both gas-phase systems and slabs using the same method is not feasible in this work. Also note that it globally underestimates the \dbe{} for O 1s (which is, \textit{e.g.}, smaller than \SI{-7}{\electronvolt} for bulk CaO\cite{cristXPSLibraryWebsite2021a}). Finally, Bagus \emph{et al.}\cite{bagusRevisitingSurfaceCorelevel2019} also argued recently that the difference between bulk and surface O 1s in CaO, which amounts to \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt} with this protocol, is overestimated  and should be $<\SI{0.1}{\electronvolt}$.

The optimized geometries of compounds \textbf{a}‚Äì\textbf{j}, following their adsorption on the slabs, are depicted in Figs.~\ref{fig:distsad}‚Äì\ref{fig:distsj}. The interaction energy, calculated as $\Delta E_{int} = E_{2X@Y} - E_Y - 2E_X$ (where $E_X$ represents the energy of a single adsorbate, placed on each side of the slab, and $E_Y$ is the energy of the substrate), is presented in Table~\ref{tab:int}. Note that no thermochemical corrections (e.g., zero-point vibrational energy) have been applied in these calculations.

	\caption{Interaction energy ($\Delta E_{int}$, in \si{\electronvolt}) between the adsorbate and the substrate.}
	\label{tab:int}
\end{table}

There are three primary modes of interaction between the substrate and the adsorbate: \begin{inparaenum}[i)] \item van der Waals (vdW) forces, 
\item hydrogen bonding (HB), and 
\item chemisorption. 
\end{inparaenum}
First, hydrocarbons (\textbf{a}‚Äì\textbf{d}) mainly interact through vdW forces, as indicated by the relatively large distances between the adsorbate and substrate (Fig.~\ref{fig:distsad}) and the low interaction energies ($E_{int} < \SI{1}{\electronvolt}$). However, for unsaturated hydrocarbons (\textbf{c}-\textbf{d}), the distances are shorter ($\sim\SI{3}{\angstrom}$) compared to saturated ones (\textbf{a}-\textbf{b}) on the \ce{Ca^0}, \ce{CaO.H2O}, and \ce{CaH2} slabs, leading to slightly higher interaction energies.

Second, HB interactions are prevalent between \ce{CaO.H2O} and carbohydrates (\textbf{e}-\textbf{j}). From \textbf{e} to \textbf{j}, interaction energies increase, which correlates with a decrease in the oxygen(substrate)--hydrogen(slab) distance. In protic hydrocarbons (\textbf{i}-\textbf{j}), HB formation occurs between the hydrogen of the substrate and the oxygen of the slab.

Lastly, carbohydrates can exhibit significant interaction energies ($> \SI{1}{\electronvolt}$) with the \ce{Ca^0} and \ce{CaH2} slabs, particularly due to oxygen--calcium interactions, accompanied by small interatomic distances, suggesting chemisorption. This is especially pronounced for \ce{CO2} (\textbf{e}, for which two possibilities exist, see Fig.~\ref{fig:distsei}) and \ce{CH2=O} (\textbf{f}) on the \ce{CaH2} slab, where both compounds undergo an increase in hybridization (\textit{e.g.}, from \ce{sp^2} to \ce{sp^3} for \textbf{f}), facilitated by interaction with a slab's hydrogen.
Interestingly, the CaO slab follows a different trend. While interactions with polar carbohydrates (\textbf{e}‚Äì\textbf{h}) result in low or even slightly positive (\textbf{h}) interaction energies (similar to vdW), protic carbohydrates (\textbf{i}-\textbf{j}) show small hydrogen(substrate)--oxygen(slab) distances, suggesting proton transfer between the substrate and slab.

These observations provide insights into potential degradation mechanisms. The proton transfers on the CaO surface support the hypothesis of hydroxyl formation on the slab. Moreover, reactions involving hydrogen from the \ce{CaH2} slab indicate possible surface reactivity under certain conditions.  It should be noted that these reaction are not necessarily associated with a important modification of the slab structure, as measured by the mean displacements of the calcium atoms after adsorption (Table S2). In fact, \ce{CaH2} tends to be the most affected by adsorption, regardless of the adsorbate.

\subsection{Binding energies of adsorbate on slabs}\label{sec:BEs}

	\begin{figure}[!h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figure#1}
		\caption{Difference (dotted line) between the XPS spectra before (dashed line) and after (solid line) adsorption for compounds \textbf{#2} on various substrates, as computed using the \cp{E_\infty} protocol.

Directly comparing binding energies (BEs) of molecules in the gas phase with those adsorbed on a slab is methodologically problematic (as discussed \textit{vide supra}). Therefore, the focus here will be on the binding energies before (slab) and after (slab + adsorbate) adsorption.

The spectra corresponding to the adsorption of compound \textbf{a} (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadsa}) is first analyzed. Adsorption induces a slight shift in the bulk BEs (labeled ``b"), which ideally should remain unaffected. While using thicker slabs could mitigate this issue, the discussion will center on the surface BEs (labeled ``s"), which exhibit the most significant changes post-adsorption. In this example, the surface calcium and oxygen atoms closest to \textbf{a} (labeled ``s$^\star$") show similar BE values, consistent with van der Waals (vdW) interactions at larger distances. Additionally, a peak corresponding to the carbon of \textbf{a} is observed around $\dbe = \SI{0}{\electronvolt}$, characteristic of a saturated carbon. The spectra for compound \textbf{b} (Fig.~S5) are quite similar, though the carbon peak is more pronounced due to the slightly different BEs of \ce{-CH3} and \ce{-CH_2-} groups, with the latter showing a higher BE.

\XPSsa{11}{a}

\clearpage

Next, the spectra of compound \textbf{c} (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadsc}) is analyzed. In this case, the surface calcium atoms in close contact with the adsorbate (labeled ``s$^\star$") experience a shift towards lower BEs. No significant changes are observed in the oxygen atoms, whose BE values remain consistent with the previous spectra. A distinct peak corresponding to the unsaturated carbon atoms appears around $\dbe = \SI{-1}{\electronvolt}$. This peak also show that the distance between the adsorbate and the surface can have an impact (here, the large the distance, the smaller \dbe{}), as reported by Taucher \emph{et al.}\cite{taucherFinalStateSimulationsCoreLevel2020}. The spectra for compound \textbf{d} (Fig.~S8) show a similar trend, with a separate peak for each type of carbon.

\XPSsa{12}{c}

Turning to compound \textbf{e} (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadse}), several notable features arise, as reaction occur between \ce{CO2} and the slab composed of \ce{Ca^0} and \ce{CaH2}. These interactions affect the oxygen spectra, resulting in two distinct peaks: one associated with oxygen bound to a linear carbon (around $\dbe = \SI{1}{\electronvolt}$, labeled ``\ce{O=C}''), and another linked to a trigonal planar carbon (around $\dbe = \SI{-2}{\electronvolt}$, labeled ``\ce{O=C}$<$''), which arises from the reaction. The relative intensities of these peaks will depend on the composition and coverage of the slab, which were not investigated in this study. In the carbon spectra, the linear carbon (labeled ``\ce{C=O}'') and the trigonal planar carbon (labeled ``$>$\ce{C=O}'') correspond to peaks located around $\dbe = \SI{3.5}{\electronvolt}$ and $\dbe = \SI{1.5}{\electronvolt}$, respectively, but with some variability: interaction between \ce{CO2} and hydrogen leads to a lager BEs for the carbon than interaction with Ca. 

\XPSsa{13}{e}

These results are in line with previous studies by Maus-Friedrichs and colleagues\cite{ochsCO2ChemisorptionCa1998,voigtsAdsorptionCO2CO2009,dahleSituPreparationCalcium2012}, which investigated the adsorption of \ce{CO2} on \ce{Ca^0} and \ce{CaO}, showing the formation of a calcite layer. Recent XPS data\cite{dahleSituPreparationCalcium2012} indicate that BE(O 1s in \ce{CO3^-}) is higher than BE(bulk O 1s in CaO) by approximately \SI{3}{\electronvolt}, a trend similar to that observed in this study, although the case here is of adsorbed \ce{CO2}. Preliminary calculations on \ce{CaCO3} (not shown here) further support this trend. It would also be interesting to obtain a geometry where \ce{CO2} reacts with \ce{CaO}.

The spectra for compounds \textbf{f} and \textbf{g} (Figs.~S7-S8) exhibit similar trends. However, the carbon in compound \textbf{f} undergoes a transition from a planar trigonal geometry to a tetragonal configuration upon reacting with \ce{CaH2}, and thus the peaks appear at lower \dbe{}. Additionally, the strong interaction between the oxygen atoms in compounds \textbf{f} and \textbf{g} and the \ce{Ca^0} substrate results in a notable shift towards lower \dbe{} values in both the O 1s and C 1s spectra.

Finally, the spectra of THF (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadsh}) and its polymer (Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraXPSadsj}) are analyzed together. Observations are: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item the peak with associated to the ether moiety in both molecules is associated to large BEs (around \SI{0}{\electronvolt} in O 1s, where it is labeled ``\ce{O-C}", and around \SI{1.5}{\electronvolt} for C 1s, labeled ``\ce{C-O}"), 
	\item for compound \textbf{j}, a second peak with lower BEs is associated to the presence of alcohol moieties (around \SI{-1}{\electronvolt} in O 1s, where it is labeled ``\ce{OH-C}", and around \SI{1.5}{\electronvolt} for C 1s, labeled ``\ce{C-OH}"), 
	\item cyclisation seems to slightly affect the peak associated with saturated carbons (labeled ``\ce{C-C}") towards larger values, and
	\item when graphted on CaO, proton transfer between PTMEG (\textbf{j}) and surface leads to a shift of about \SI{-2}{\electronvolt}  (thus similar to the value for compounds \textbf{f}) in the O 1s spectrum and of about \SI{0.7}{\electronvolt} in C 1s (again, becoming similar to compound \textbf{f}). This is also the case for compound \textbf{i} (Fig.~S9).
\end{inparaenum}

\XPSsa{14}{h}
\XPSsa{15}{j}

The trends among all the spectra are reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:trends}. Since Ca 2s is not very sensitive to the environment, it was not reported. The BE value for C 1s and O 1s are proportional to the electronegativity of their neighbours, as expected.\cite{stevieIntroductionXrayPhotoelectron2020} An important results of this paper is the large impact of the interaction between oxygen and \ce{Ca^0} on the BE.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this study, the adsorption of a model system, THF, and its potential degradation products on various calcium surfaces was investigated using quantum chemistry calculations. Slabs of calcium (\ce{Ca^0}), its oxide (\ce{CaO}), and its hydride (\ce{CaH2}) were carefully constructed, with full hydroxide coverage also considered for \ce{CaO}. Geometry optimizations were performed for both the bare slabs and the adsorbate-slab complexes. The interactions ranged from van der Waals forces to chemisorption. Two key reaction types were identified: reactions between the adsorbate‚Äôs carbon atoms and the surface (notably with \ce{CO2}), and proton transfers between alcohol moiety in the adsorbate and the \ce{CaO} surface. The first reaction is known to lead to the formation of calcite\cite{dahleSituPreparationCalcium2012}, while the second might indicate some of the mecanism for the formation of hydroxyls.

Since XPS provides valuable insights into the chemical environment of atoms and the transformations they undergo during adsorption to experimentalists, the simulation of these spectra was performed. However, careful attention must be paid to the methodologies employed, as direct comparisons between results can be problematic due to potential inconsistencies across different systems. To address these issues, a thorough assessment of the methodological approaches was conducted. This evaluation indicates that while the \cp[n]{0} protocol is suitable for gas-phase molecules, the \cp{E_\infty} protocol more accurately reproduces experimental trends for calcium slabs and their derivatives.

After validating the methodology, it was applied to the various systems. The reactions between the adsorbate and the surface led to significant changes in the O 1s and C 1s spectra, although the Ca 2s binding energies appeared less affected. Notably, the interactions between oxygen and \ce{Ca^0} were also clearly observable in the spectra. Our results are also in line with experimental studies on the adsorption of \ce{CO2} on calcium surfaces.\cite{voigtsAdsorptionCO2CO2009}

Taken together, these findings establish trends for analyzing XPS spectra in the context of SEI formation. Future studies should now explore the impact of incorporating boron derivatives or other counterions to coordinates \ce{Ca^2+}. For example, fluorinated byproducts should be important if  \ce{BF4-} is considered. However, conducting such research requires a detailed mechanistic understanding of the degradation reactions involving these species.\cite{youngPreventingElectrolyteDecomposition2021,yamijalaStabilityCalciumIon2021,baonguyenInvestigatingAbnormalConductivity2022,nguyenSolvationReductionCoupling2023}
